**Cursor 2.0** launched with **Composer-1**, an agentic coding model optimized for speed and precision, featuring multi-agent orchestration, built-in browser for testing, and voice-to-code capabilities. **OpenAI** released **gpt-oss-safeguard** models (20B, 120B) for policy-based safety classification, open-weight and fine-tuned from gpt-oss, available on Hugging Face and supported by inference stacks like Ollama and Cerebras. **Goodfire** and **Rakuten** demonstrated sparse autoencoders for PII detection matching **gpt-5-mini** accuracy at significantly lower cost. The Cursor 2.0 update also includes a redesigned interface for managing multiple AI coding agents, marking a major advancement in AI IDEs. \*"Fast-not-slowest" tradeoff emphasized by early users for Composer-1, enabling rapid iteration with human-in-the-loop.\*
