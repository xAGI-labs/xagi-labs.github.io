**OpenAI** released the new **o1** model, leveraging reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting to excel in reasoning benchmarks, achieving an IQ-like score of **120**. **Google DeepMind** introduced **DataGemma** to reduce hallucinations by connecting LLMs with real-world data, and unveiled **ALOHA** and **DemoStart** for robot dexterity using diffusion methods. **Adobe** previewed its **Firefly AI Video Model** with text-to-video and generative extend features. **Mistral** launched the multimodal **Pixtral 12B** model, and **Tencent** presented the **GameGen-O** open-world video game generation model. Several research papers from **Stanford**, **OpenAI**, **Microsoft**, **Mila**, and **Notre Dame** focus on advanced reasoning, self-verification, and reflection tuning techniques. Experts like **Terence Tao** and **George Hotz** have shared mixed but optimistic views on o1's capabilities. Seed funding rounds include **Supermaven** ($12M) and **11x** ($24M).
