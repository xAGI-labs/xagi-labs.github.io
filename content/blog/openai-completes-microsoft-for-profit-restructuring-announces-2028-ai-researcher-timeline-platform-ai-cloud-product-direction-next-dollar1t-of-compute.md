**OpenAI** has completed a major recapitalization and restructuring, forming a Public Benefit Corporation with a non-profit Foundation holding special voting rights and equity valued at **$130B**. **Microsoft** holds about **27%** diluted ownership and committed to **$250B** in Azure spend, losing exclusivity on compute but retaining Azure API exclusivity until AGI is declared. The compute infrastructure deals for 2025 total **30GW** worth **$1.4T**, with OpenAI aiming to build **1GW per week** at **$20B per GW**, projecting **$3-4 trillion** infrastructure by 2033. The company is shifting focus from first-party apps to a platform approach, emphasizing ecosystem growth and third-party development. **Sam Altman** and **Sama** are key figures in this transition, with significant financial and strategic implications for AI industry partnerships, including openness to **Anthropic** and **Google Gemini** on Azure.
