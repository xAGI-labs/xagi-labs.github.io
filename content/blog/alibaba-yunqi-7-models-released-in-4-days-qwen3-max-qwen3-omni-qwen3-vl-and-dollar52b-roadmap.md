**Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) team** launched major updates including the **1T parameter Qwen3-Max**, **Qwen3-Omni**, and **Qwen3-VL** models, alongside specialized versions like **Qwen3Guard**, **Qwen3-LiveTranslate**, **Qwen3-TTS-Flash**, **Qwen-Image-Edit**, and **Qwen3Coder**. At the **AliCloud Yunqi (Apsara) conference**, CEO **Eddie Wu** outlined a $52B roadmap emphasizing two AI development stages: "intelligence emergence" focusing on learning from humans and reasoning, and "autonomous action" highlighting AI's tool use and real-world task execution. The updates showcase advances in **tool use**, **large-model coding capabilities**, and AI's expanding role across industries such as logistics, manufacturing, biomedicine, and finance. Junyang Lin and Alibaba Wan are key spokespersons for these developments. The Qwen project is now seen as a "frontier lab" for AI innovation.
