**Reve**, a new composite AI model from former Adobe and Stability alums **Christian Cantrell**, **Taesung Park**, and **Michaël Gharbi**, has emerged as the top-rated image generation model, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models like Recraft and Ideogram in text rendering and typography. The team emphasizes \*"enhancing visual generative models with logic"\* and \*"understanding user intent with advanced language capabilities"\* to iteratively amend visuals based on natural language input. Additionally, **DeepSeek-V3-0324** and **Alibaba's Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct** models were released with notable performance improvements, including better vision task benchmarks and mathematical reasoning.
