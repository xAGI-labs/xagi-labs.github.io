**ChatGPT** launched its search functionality across all platforms using a fine-tuned version of **GPT-4o** with synthetic data generation and distillation from **o1-preview**. This feature includes a Chrome extension promoted by **Sam Altman** but has issues with hallucinations. The launch coincides with **Gemini** introducing Search Grounding after delays. Notably, **The New York Times** is not a partner due to a lawsuit against **OpenAI**. The AI search competition intensifies with consumer and B2B players like **Perplexity** and **Glean**. Additionally, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** achieved a new benchmark record on SWE-bench Verified, and a new hallucination evaluation benchmark, SimpleQA, was introduced. Other highlights include the **Universal-2** speech-to-text model with 660M parameters and **HOVER**, a neural whole-body controller for humanoid robots trained in NVIDIA Isaac simulation. AI hedge fund teams using **LangChain** and **LangGraph** were also showcased. The news is sponsored by the RAG++ course featuring experts from **Weights & Biases**, **Cohere**, and **Weaviate**.
