**OpenAI** and **Google DeepMind** achieved a major milestone by solving 5 out of 6 problems at the **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2025** within the human time limit of 4.5 hours, earning the IMO Gold medal. This breakthrough was accomplished using general-purpose reinforcement learning and pure in-weights reasoning without specialized tools or internet access, surpassing previous systems like AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry2. The success resolved a 3-year-old AI bet on AI's capability to solve IMO problems and sparked discussions among mathematicians including **Terence Tao**. Despite this, 26 human competitors remain better than AI on the hardest combinatorics problem (P6). The achievement highlights advances in **reinforcement-learning**, **reasoning**, and **model-scaling** in AI research.
