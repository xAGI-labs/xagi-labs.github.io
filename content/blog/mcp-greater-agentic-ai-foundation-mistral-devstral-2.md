**OpenAI Engineering** sees a significant collaborative milestone with the launch of the **Agentic AI Foundation** under the Linux Foundation, uniting projects from **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and **Block**. **Mistral** released **Devstral 2**, a coding model with **123B parameters** and open weights, offering a cost-effective alternative to **Sonnet 4.3** and competitive performance against **DeepSeek v3.2**. The new **Mistral Vibe CLI** supports agentic coding workflows with rapid ecosystem integration. **Alibaba** introduced **Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO)** for reinforcement learning tuning, improving stability and performance in **Qwen3-VL** across multiple tasks. Research highlights include the importance of data decontamination in RL and ongoing discussions on MoE RL stability and reward hacking mitigation.
