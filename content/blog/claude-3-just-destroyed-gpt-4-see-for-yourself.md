**Claude 3** from **Anthropic** launches in three sizes: Haiku (small, unreleased), Sonnet (medium, default on claude.ai, AWS, and GCP), and Opus (large, on Claude Pro). Opus outperforms **GPT-4** on key benchmarks like GPQA, impressing benchmark authors. All models support **multimodality** with advanced vision capabilities, including converting a 2-hour video into a blog post. Claude 3 offers improved alignment, fewer refusals, and extended context length up to **1 million tokens** with near-perfect recall. Haiku is noted for speed and cost-efficiency, processing dense research papers in under three seconds. The models excel at following complex instructions and producing structured outputs like JSON. Safety improvements reduce refusal rates, though some criticism remains from experts. Claude 3 is trained on synthetic data and shows strong domain-specific evaluation results in finance, medicine, and philosophy.
