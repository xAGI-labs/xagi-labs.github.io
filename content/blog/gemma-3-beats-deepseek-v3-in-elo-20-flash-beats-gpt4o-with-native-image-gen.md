**Google DeepMind** launched the **Gemma 3** family of models featuring a **128k context window**, **multimodal input (image and video)**, and **multilingual support for 140+ languages**. The **Gemma 3-27B** model ranks among the top open models on LMArena benchmarks, outperforming several competitors and matching **Gemini-1.5-Pro** on benchmarks. Additionally, **Gemini 2** introduced **Flash Native Image Generation** with advanced image editing capabilities, a feature teased by OpenAI but not launched. The updates highlight significant advances in context length, multimodality, and model efficiency via quantization.
