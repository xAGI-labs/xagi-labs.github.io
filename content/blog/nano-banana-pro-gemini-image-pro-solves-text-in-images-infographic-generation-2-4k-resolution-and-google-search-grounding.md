**Google** launched **Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)**, a next-generation AI image generation and editing model with integrated Google Search grounding, multi-image composition, and fine-grained visual controls, offering pricing at $0.134 per 2K image and $0.24 per 4K image. It features improved text rendering with error rates dropping from 56% to 8% compared to its predecessor, and includes SynthID watermark checks for provenance. The model is available via Gemini App, API, LM Arena, Hugging Face Spaces, Together AI, and Flow. Meanwhile, **OpenAI** shared early experiments with **GPT-5** accelerating scientific research, including proofs of previously unsolved problems in math, physics, biology, and materials science. \*"GPT-5 accelerated research tasks in math/physics/biology/materials; in 4, it helped find proofs of previously unsolved problems."\*
