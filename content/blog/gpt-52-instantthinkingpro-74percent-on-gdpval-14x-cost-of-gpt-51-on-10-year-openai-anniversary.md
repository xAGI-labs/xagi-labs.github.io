Despite some mixed results in coding benchmarks and vision capabilities, GPT-5.2 is well received as a major update with extended context and tiered reasoning controls. Pricing is set at **$1.75/M input** and **$14/M output** tokens with a 90% cache discount. The update is live in ChatGPT and API, marking a significant milestone for OpenAI's LLM development.
