**AI Discords for 2/2/2024** analyzed **21 guilds**, **312 channels**, and **4782 messages** saving an estimated **382 minutes** of reading time. Discussions included **Eugene Yan** initiating a deep dive into **AI engineering** challenges, highlighting overlaps between software engineering and data science skills. The **TheBloke Discord** featured talks on **MiquMaid**, **OLMo** (an open-source 65B LLM by **AI2** under Apache 2.0), **Aphrodite** model batching, **AWQ** quantization, and **LoRA** fine-tuning techniques like **QLoRA** and **LoftQ**. The **LAION Discord** discussed **SSD-1B** distillation issues, data quality optimization with captioning datasets like **BLIP**, **COCO**, and **LLaVA**, and tokenization strategies for prompt adherence in image generation. Other topics included AI security with watermarking, superconductors and carbon nanotubes for hardware, and deployment of LLMs via **Hugging Face** tools.
