**Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)** is introduced as a **data-efficient** method to improve **reasoning in LLMs** using minimal **training data** with strategies like **First-Correct Solutions (FCS)** and **Greedily Diverse Solutions (GDS)**. **DeepSeek-V3**, a **671B parameter MoE language model** trained on **14.8 trillion tokens** with **FP8 mixed precision training**, highlights advances in large-scale models and open-source LLMs. Predictions for **AI in 2025** include growth in **smaller models**, **multimodality**, and challenges in **open-source AI**. The impact of AI on software development jobs suggests a need for **higher intelligence** and **specialization** as AI automates low-skilled tasks. Enhancements to **CodeLLM** improve coding assistance with features like **in-place editing** and **streaming responses**. **Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL)** offers better interpretability and richer feedback for AI planning and critique. AI hiring is growing rapidly with startups seeking strong engineers in **ML** and **systems**. New AI-powered tools such as **Rivet**, **Buzee**, and **Konfig** improve real-time applications, search, and SDK generation using technologies like **Rust** and **V8 isolates**.
