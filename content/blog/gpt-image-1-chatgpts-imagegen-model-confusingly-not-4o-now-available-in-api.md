**OpenAI** officially launched the **gpt-image-1** API for image generation and editing, supporting features like alpha channel transparency and a "low" content moderation policy. **OpenAI's** models **o3** and **o4-mini** are leading in benchmarks for style control, math, coding, and hard prompts, with **o3** ranking #1 in several categories. A new benchmark called **Vending-Bench** reveals performance variance in LLMs on extended tasks. **GPT-4.1** ranks in the top 5 for hard prompts and math. **Nvidia's** **Eagle 2.5-8B** matches **GPT-4o** and **Qwen2.5-VL-72B** in long-video understanding. AI supercomputer performance doubles every 9 months, with **xAI's Colossus** costing an estimated $7 billion and the US dominating 75% of global performance. The Virology Capabilities Test shows **OpenAI's o3** outperforms 94% of expert virologists. **Nvidia** also released the **Describe Anything Model (DAM)**, a multimodal LLM for detailed image and video captioning, now available on Hugging Face.
