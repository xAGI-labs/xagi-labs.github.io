**OpenAI**'s Evals team released **GDPval**, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering 1,320 tasks across 44 predominantly digital occupations, assessing AI models against human experts with 14 years average experience. Early results show **Claude 4.1 Opus** outperforming human experts in most categories and **GPT-5 high** trailing behind, with projections that **GPTnext** could match human performance by mid-2026. The benchmark is positioned as a key metric for policymakers and labor impact forecasting. Additionally, **Artificial Analysis** reported improvements in **Gemini 2.5 Flash/Flash-Lite** and **DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus** models, alongside new speech-to-text benchmarks (AA-WER) highlighting leaders like **Google Chirp 2** and **NVIDIA Canary Qwen2.5B**.
