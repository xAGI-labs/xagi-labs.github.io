**OpenAI** published a paper introducing the concept of privilege levels for LLMs to address prompt injection vulnerabilities, improving defenses by 20-30%. **Microsoft** released the lightweight **Phi-3-mini** model with 4K and 128K context lengths. **Apple** open-sourced the **OpenELM** language model family with an open training and inference framework. An instruction accuracy benchmark compared 12 models, with **Claude 3 Opus**, **GPT-4 Turbo**, and **Llama 3 70B** performing best. The **Rho-1** method enables training state-of-the-art models using only 3% of tokens, boosting models like **Mistral**. **Wendy's** deployed AI-powered drive-thru ordering, and a study found **Gen Z** workers prefer generative AI for career advice. Tutorials on deploying **Llama 3** models on AWS EC2 highlight hardware requirements and inference server use.
