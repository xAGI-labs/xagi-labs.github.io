**Cursor**, an AI-native IDE, announced a **speculative edits** algorithm for code editing that surpasses **GPT-4** and **GPT-4o** in accuracy and latency, achieving speeds of over **1000 tokens/s** on a **70b** model. **OpenAI** released **GPT-4o** with multimodal capabilities including audio, vision, and text, noted to be **2x faster and 50% cheaper** than GPT-4 turbo, though with mixed coding performance. **Anthropic** introduced streaming, forced tool use, and vision features for developers. **Google DeepMind** unveiled **Imagen Video** and **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, a small model with a **1M-context** window. **HuggingFace** is distributing **$10M** in free GPUs for open-source AI models like **Llama**, **BLOOM**, and **Stable Diffusion**. Evaluation insights highlight challenges with LLMs on novel problems and benchmark saturation, with new benchmarks like **MMLU-Pro** showing significant drops in top model performance.
