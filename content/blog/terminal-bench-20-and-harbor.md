**Terminal-Bench** has fixed task issues and launched version 2.0 with cloud container support via the **Harbor framework**, gaining recognition from models like **Claude 4.5** and **Kimi K2 Thinking**. **Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 Thinking** is a 1 trillion parameter MoE reasoning model with ~32B active parameters, running natively in **INT4 quantization** and featuring a 256K context window. It leads open-weights benchmarks with an Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index score of **67** and strong agentic performance, running efficiently on consumer Apple silicon and 2× M3 Ultra hardware. The model is broadly available on **Hugging Face**, **Ollama Cloud**, and integrated into frameworks like slime. Serving bottlenecks were traced to network bandwidth rather than GPU limits, highlighting infrastructure considerations for LLM deployment.
