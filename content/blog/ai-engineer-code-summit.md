The recent **AIE Code Summit** showcased key developments including **Google DeepMind's Gemini 3 Pro Image model, Nano Banana Pro**, which features enhanced text rendering, 4K visuals, and fine-grained editing capabilities. Community feedback highlights its strong performance in design and visualization tasks, with high user preference scores. Benchmarking updates reveal the new **CritPt physics frontier benchmark** where Gemini 3 Pro outperforms GPT-5, though AI still lags on complex unseen research problems. Agentic task evaluations show varied time horizons and performance gaps between open-weight and closed frontier models, emphasizing ongoing challenges in AI research and deployment. \*"Instruction following remains jagged for some users,"\* and model fit varies by use case, with Gemini 3 excelling in UI and code tasks but showing regressions in transcription and writing fidelity.
