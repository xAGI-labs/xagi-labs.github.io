**OpenAI** announced placing **#6 among human coders** at the IOI, reflecting rapid progress in competitive coding AI over the past two years. The **GPT-5** launch faced significant user backlash over restrictive usage limits and removal of model selection control, leading to a reversal and increased limits to **3000 requests per week** for Plus users. Confusion around **GPT-5** naming and benchmarking was highlighted, with critiques on methodological issues comparing models like **Claude** and **Gemini**. Performance reviews of **GPT-5** are mixed, with claims of near-zero hallucinations by **OpenAI** staff but user reports of confidence in hallucinations and steering difficulties. Benchmarks show **GPT-5 mini** performing well on document understanding, while the full **GPT-5** is seen as expensive and middling. On the Chatbot Arena, **Gemini 2.5 Pro** holds a **67%** winrate against **GPT-5 Thinking**. Prompting and model behavior remain key discussion points.
