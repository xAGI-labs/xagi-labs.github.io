**OpenAI** is rumored to soon launch new **GPT-OSS** and **GPT-5** models amid drama with **Anthropic** revoking access to **Claude**. **Google DeepMind** quietly launched **Gemini 2.5 Deep Think**, a model optimized for parallel thinking that achieved gold-medal level at the IMO and excels in reasoning, coding, and creative tasks. Leaks suggest **OpenAI** is developing a **120B MoE** and a **20B** model with advanced attention mechanisms. Chinese AI companies like **Kimi Moonshot**, **Alibaba**, and **ZHIpu AI** are releasing faster and more capable open models such as **kimi-k2-turbo-preview**, **Qwen3-Coder-Flash**, and **GLM-4.5**, signaling strong momentum and potential to surpass the U.S. in AI development. \*"The final checkpoint was selected just 5 hours before the IMO problems were released,"\* highlighting rapid development cycles.
