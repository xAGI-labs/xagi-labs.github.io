**Anthropic** introduced a novel 'think' tool enhancing instruction adherence and multi-step problem solving in agents, with combined reasoning and tool use demonstrated by **Claude**. **NVIDIA**'s **Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1** ranked #14 on LMArena, noted for strong math reasoning and a 15M post-training dataset. **Sakana AI** launched a Sudoku-based reasoning benchmark to advance AI problem-solving capabilities. **Meta AI** released **SWEET-RL**, a reinforcement learning algorithm improving long-horizon multi-turn tasks by 6%, and introduced **CollaborativeAgentBench**, a benchmark for collaborative LLM agents working with humans on programming and design tasks. **Percy Liang** relaunched the **HELM** benchmark with 5 challenging datasets evaluating 22 top language models.
