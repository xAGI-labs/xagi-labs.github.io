**OpenAI** released **Canvas**, an enhanced writing and coding tool based on **GPT-4o**, featuring inline suggestions, seamless editing, and a collaborative environment. Early feedback compares it to **Cursor** and **Claude Artifacts**, noting strengths and some execution issues. OpenAI also sponsors **Marijn Haverbeke**, creator of **ProseMirror** and **CodeMirror**, which are used in Canvas. The integration involved training a detector to trigger Canvas appropriately, achieving **83% accuracy** in correct triggers. Unlike Claude Artifacts, Canvas currently lacks Mermaid Diagrams and HTML preview support. Additionally, **Daily** is sponsoring a **$20,000** voice AI hackathon in San Francisco, highlighting voice AI as a key emerging skill.
