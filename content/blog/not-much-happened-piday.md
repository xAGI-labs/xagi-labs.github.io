**DeepMind** announces **SIMA**, a generalist AI agent capable of following natural language instructions across diverse 3D environments and video games, advancing embodied AI agents. **Anthropic** releases **Claude 3 Haiku**, their fastest and most affordable model, now available via API and Perplexity. New research explores language model scaling laws, over-training, and introduces **Branch-Train-MiX (BTX)** for efficient training of large language models using mixture-of-experts. Predictions suggest software engineering jobs will grow to **30-35 million** in five years, aided by AI coding assistants like **Cohere's Command-R** focusing on retrieval-augmented generation and tool use. The **EU AI Act** is approved, mandating transparency in training data for GPAI systems. Privacy-preserving in-context learning with differential privacy is highlighted as promising work. Memes humorously discuss AI software engineers and notable figures like **Andrej Karpathy**.
