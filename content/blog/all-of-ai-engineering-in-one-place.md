The upcoming **AI Engineer World's Fair** in San Francisco from **June 25-27** will feature a significantly expanded format with booths, talks, and workshops from **top model labs** like **OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere, HuggingFace**, and **Character.ai**. It includes participation from **Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Vertex**, and major companies such as **Nvidia, Salesforce, Mastercard, Palo Alto Networks**, and more. The event covers **9 tracks** including **RAG, multimodality, evals/ops, open models, code generation, GPUs, agents, AI in Fortune 500**, and a new **AI leadership** track. Additionally, **Anthropic** shared interpretability research on **Claude 3 Sonnet**, revealing millions of interpretable features that can be steered to modify model behavior, including safety-relevant features related to bias and unsafe content, though more research is needed for practical applications. The event offers a discount code for AI News readers.
