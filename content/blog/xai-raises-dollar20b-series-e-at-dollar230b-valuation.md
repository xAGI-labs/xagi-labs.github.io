\*\*xAI\*\*, Elon Musk's AI company, completed a massive \*\*$20 billion Series E funding round\*\*, valuing it at about \*\*$230 billion\*\* with investors like \*\*Nvidia\*\*, \*\*Cisco Investments\*\*, and others. The funds will support AI infrastructure expansion including \*\*Colossus I and II supercomputers\*\* and training \*\*Grok 5\*\*, leveraging data from \*\*X's 600 million monthly active users\*\*. At \*\*CES 2026\*\*, the focus was on "AI everywhere" with a strong emphasis on \*\*AI-first hardware\*\* and integration between \*\*NVIDIA\*\* and \*\*Hugging Face's LeRobot\*\* for robotics development. The \*\*Reachy Mini\*\* robot is gaining traction as a consumer robotics platform. In software, \*\*Claude Code\*\* is emerging as a popular local/private coding assistant, with new UI features in \*\*Claude Desktop\*\* and innovations like \*\*Cursor's dynamic context\*\* reducing token usage by nearly \*\*47%\*\* in multi-MCP setups. \*"The 600 million MAU figure in xAI’s announcement combines X platform users with Grok users. That’s a clever framing choice."\*
