**Cohere's Command A Reasoning** model outperforms GPT-OSS in open deep research capabilities, emphasizing agentic use cases for 2025. **DeepSeek-V3.1** introduces a hybrid reasoning architecture toggling between reasoning and non-reasoning modes, optimized for agentic workflows and coding, with extensive long-context pretraining (~630B tokens for 32k context, ~209B for 128k), FP8 training, and a large MoE expert count (~37B). Benchmarks show competitive performance with notable improvements in SWE-Bench and other reasoning tasks. The model supports a $0.56/M input and $1.68/M output pricing on the DeepSeek API and enjoys rapid ecosystem integration including HF weights, INT4 quantization by Intel, and vLLM reasoning toggles. Community feedback highlights the hybrid design's pragmatic approach to agent and software engineering workflows, though some note the lack of tool use in reasoning mode.
