At **Google Cloud Next**, **Gemini 1.5 Pro** was released with a **million-token context window**, available in **180+ countries**, featuring **9.5 hours of audio understanding**, a new **File API** for nearly unlimited free uploads, and the **Gecko-1b-256/768 embedding model**. **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision** became generally available in the API with a major update improving reasoning capabilities. **Meta Platforms** plans to launch smaller versions of **Llama 3** next week. The **Orca 2.5 7B** model using Direct Nash Optimization outperforms older GPT-4 versions in AlpacaEval. New releases include **Functionary-V2.4** with enhanced function calling and code interpretation, and **CosXL** models for image editing. Research highlights include continuous U-Nets for diffusion models achieving up to **80% faster inference** and a massive multilingual dataset with **~5.6 trillion word tokens**. Creative applications include a no-code touch screen game made with Gemini 1.5 and AI-generated novel trailers.
