**Artificial Analysis** launched a new models and hosts comparison site, highlighted by **swyx**. **Nous Research AI** Discord discussed innovative summarization techniques using **NVIDIA 3090 and 2080ti GPUs** for processing around **100k tokens**, and adapting prompts for smaller models like **OpenChat 7B**. The availability of **Hermes 2 Mixtral** on **Huggingface's HuggingChat** was noted, alongside fine-tuning challenges with **Mixtral** using Axolotl. Discussions included byte-level tokenization experiments with **Byte Mistral**, multimodal training on **COCO image bytes**, and inference speed improvements using **vllm** and **llama.cpp**. Calls for transparency in data sharing and open-sourcing the **Hermes 2 Mixtral** dataset were emphasized, with comparisons of **dpo** and **sft** methods and quantized LLM use on **M1 MacBook Pro**.
