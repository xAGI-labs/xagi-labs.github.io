**François Chollet** critiques current paths to **AGI**, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that resist saturation and focus on skill acquisition and open-ended problem solving. The **ARC-AGI** puzzles exemplify "easy for humans, hard for AI" challenges to measure progress toward AGI. Meanwhile, **Apple** announces integration of **ChatGPT** into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS through a partnership with **OpenAI**, enabling AI-powered features like document summarization and photo analysis with privacy-preserving measures. Discussions highlight Apple's focus on deep AI integration and on-device models optimized with techniques like mixed-precision quantization, though some skepticism remains about their AI capabilities compared to **GPT-4**. Additionally, **Together Compute** introduces a Mixture of Agents approach achieving strong performance on **AlpacaEval 2.0**.
