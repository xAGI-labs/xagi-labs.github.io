**Aaron Defazio** is gaining attention for proposing a potential tuning-free replacement of the long-standing **Adam optimizer**, showing promising experimental results across classic machine learning benchmarks like ImageNet ResNet-50 and CIFAR-10/100. On Reddit, **Claude 3 Opus** has surpassed all **OpenAI** models on the LMSys leaderboard, while a user pretrained a **LLaMA-based 300M** model outperforming **bert-large** on language modeling tasks with a modest budget. The new **MambaMixer** architecture demonstrates promising results in vision and time series forecasting. In image generation, **Stable Diffusion 1.5** with LoRAs achieves realistic outputs, and the **WDXL** release showcases impressive capabilities. AI applications include an AI-generated Nike spec ad and a chatbot built with OpenAI models that may resist prompt injections. OpenAI is reportedly planning a ban wave targeting policy violators and jailbreak users. \*"The high alpha seems to come from Aaron Defazio,"\* highlighting his impactful work in optimizer research.
