**Nvidia and Intel** announced a joint development partnership for multiple new generations of x86 products, marking a significant shift in the tech industry. This collaboration has been in the works for a year and impacts both consumer and data center markets, boosting hopes for Intel's Foundry business. On the AI hardware front, **Meta** showcased its neural band and Ray-Ban Display with a live demo that experienced hiccups but sparked discussion on live tech demos. Meta is also moving from Unity to its own Horizon Engine for AI rendering, including Gaussian splatting capture technology. In AI models, **Mistral** released Magistral 1.2, a compact multimodal vision-language model with improved benchmarks and local deployment capabilities, while **Moondream 3** previewed a 9B-parameter, 2B-active MoE VLM focused on efficient visual reasoning.
