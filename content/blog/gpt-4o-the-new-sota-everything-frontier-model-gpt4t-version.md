**OpenAI** launched **GPT-4o**, a frontier model supporting real-time reasoning across **audio, vision, and text**, now free for all ChatGPT users with enhanced coding capabilities and upcoming advanced voice and video features. Discussions cover **open-source LLMs** like **Llama 3**, fine-tuning techniques including knowledge distillation for **GPT-3.5**, and hardware optimization strategies such as quantization. Emerging architectures include multimodal integrations with ChatGPT voice and Open Interpreter API, Mixture of Experts models combining autoregressive and diffusion approaches, and novel designs like the **YOCO architecture** and **ThunderKittens DSL** for efficient GPU use. Research advances in efficient attention methods like **Conv-Basis** using FFT and model scaling techniques such as depth upscaling were also highlighted.
