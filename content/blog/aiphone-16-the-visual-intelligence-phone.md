**Apple** announced the new **iPhone 16** lineup featuring **Visual Intelligence**, a new AI capability integrated with Camera Control, Apple Maps, and Siri, emphasizing privacy and default service use over third-party AI like OpenAI. **Apple Photos** now includes advanced video understanding with timestamp recognition. Meanwhile, **Reflection-70B** claims to be a top open-source model but benchmarks show it performs close to **Llama 3 70B** and slightly worse than **Qwen 2 72B**. **Yann LeCun** highlighted ongoing challenges with LLM planning abilities, noting models like **Llama-3.1-405b** and **Claude** show some skill, while **GPT-4** and **Gemini** lag behind. **Weights & Biases** is sponsoring an event to advance LLM evaluation techniques with prizes and API access.
