3 months after OpenAI floated a trial balloon with [ChatGPT Apps and the Apps SDK at Dev Day 2025](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-10-06-devday), Anthropic has now officially absorbed [the independent MCP UI project](https://x.com/liadyosef/status/2002104900843679818) and, working with OpenAI, Block, VS Code, Antigravity, JetBrains, AWS, and others, has released both:

*   [the MCP Apps spec](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/)
*   [official support in Claude.ai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2015851783655194640)

It's fair to say that ChatGPT Apps haven't exactly taken the world by storm since announcement, but the overall need for a standard format for applications to return rich UI still cannot be denied. Now that MCP Apps have been ratified by all the important players, this is the basis for a rich ecosystem of open source support and applications being able to interoperate, and perhaps one day solve the perpetual never ending pile of $20/month subscriptions piling up in your credit card bills.

AI Twitter Recap
================

**Agent Orchestration, RLMs, and “Clawdbot/Clawd” as a UX pattern**

*   **NVIDIA ToolOrchestra + Orchestrator-8B**: NVIDIA’s ToolOrchestra frames agentic systems as a _small “conductor” model_ that alternates reasoning with calls to tools and larger “expert” models (search, code execution, specialist LLMs, frontier generalists). The claim is that an **8B orchestrator** can reach _frontier-level outcomes_ via delegation at materially lower cost, trained end-to-end with **scalable RL** using automatically synthesized tool-use environments and multi-turn tasks ([summary](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2015565947827110255), [link](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2015565962419048712)). Closest technical implication: “controller scale” matters less than _policy quality + tool/model routing_ if you can train it with realistic tool-call rollouts.
*   **RLMs / recursion-first agent stacks**: Several posts converge on a **Recursive Language Model (RLM)** pattern: pass files and context _by reference_ and iteratively pull the minimum slices needed (shell/grep/AST), rather than stuffing everything into context à la ReAct. Dan B illustrates this with file references vs `@file` expansion as deliberate **context management** ([thread](https://twitter.com/irl_danB/status/2015813778504372601)). Daytona is positioning RLMs as “unlimited recursion depth” via per-(sub)agent sandboxes ([guide](https://twitter.com/ivanburazin/status/2015818845303271896), [integration](https://twitter.com/a1zhang/status/2015820458709471640)).
*   **“Clawd/Clawdbot” meme → product signal**: The dataset contains a large “Clawdbot” wave (often with Mac mini jokes), but the technically relevant throughline is _outcome-first assistant UX_ + **tight context/tool integration**. Kimmonismus explicitly calls this a shift from “more chat” to “more outcome,” suggesting incumbents will scramble to match it ([tweet](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2015785094791713006)). Others push a cloud-first counterpoint (no local Mac mini) ([MiniMax reply](https://twitter.com/SkylerMiao7/status/2015596649171804613)). There’s also an emerging _security backlash_ as soon as “powerful mode” exists: prompt injection remains a system-level blocker for browser/desktop agents ([dilemma](https://twitter.com/fabianstelzer/status/2015671497180827785), [follow-up](https://twitter.com/fabianstelzer/status/2015702808465420614), [Miessler warnings](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/2015865548714975475)).

**Reasoning model releases & eval dynamics (Qwen, Tencent, ARC, etc.)**

*   **Alibaba Qwen3-Max-Thinking**: Alibaba positions Qwen3-Max-Thinking as a flagship reasoning+agent model trained with “massive scale and advanced RL,” emphasizing **adaptive tool-use** (Search/Memory/Code Interpreter) and **test-time scaling/self-reflection**. They cite strong math and agentic search metrics (e.g., **98.0 on HMMT Feb**, **49.8 on HLE**) ([launch](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2015805330652111144)). The model is immediately pushed into public eval channels: LM Arena Text Arena ([Arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2015803787680808996)) and Yupp ([Yupp](https://twitter.com/yupp_ai/status/2015812409823522952)). Community reaction highlights the _tool-enabled evaluation regime_—claims of outperforming multiple SOTA models on HLE _with search tools_ ([commentary](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2015820838243561742)).
*   **Tencent HunyuanImage 3.0-Instruct (image editing)**: Tencent releases an image-editing-focused multimodal model built on an **80B MoE** (13B active), using a “Thinking” schema with native CoT and their **MixGRPO** algorithm; focus is on precise edits that preserve non-target regions and multi-image fusion ([announcement](https://twitter.com/TencentHunyuan/status/2015635861833167074)). LM Arena reports it entering the **top-10 image edit leaderboard** (rank #7) ([Arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2015846799446311337)).
*   **ARC-AGI cost/perf hacks**: A notable optimization claim: “Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA) + Gemini 3 Flash” reaching **59.31% on ARC-AGI-2 at ~1/10 cost** vs Gemini Deep Think ([tweet](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2015717203362926643)). This points to a broader theme: _meta-inference strategies_ (aggregation, recursion, pruning) are becoming as important as base model choice.
*   **Open models in arenas**: Molmo 2 (Apache 2.0) appears in Arena as a new open model entrant ([Arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2015886736136798723)). Separately, Hugging Face Inference Endpoint notes **GLM-4.7-Flash via llama.cpp** with a low hourly price point (Q4\_K\_M, 24k context) ([ngxson](https://twitter.com/ngxson/status/2015763148523897097))—underscoring a continued commoditization of _fast open-weight inference_.

**RL everywhere: test-time training, GRPO stabilization, RL-as-pretraining, and compute savings**

*   **Test-Time Training (TTT) + RL breakthroughs**: A widely shared result claims a Stanford/NVIDIA-style TTT+RL approach that: beats AlphaEvolve, finds a new upper bound for an Erdős overlap problem, produces **A100 kernels ~2× faster** than best human kernels, and beats both best AI+human attempts on AtCoder ([rronak\_](https://twitter.com/rronak_/status/2015649459552850113)). This cluster also includes meta-discussion about correctly crediting related approaches (EvoTune) ([Yejin Cho](https://twitter.com/YejinChoinka/status/2015566349444190432)).
*   **GRPO training stability knobs**: A small but actionable engineering tip: INTELLECT-2 reports a **`delta=4.0`** parameter that improves GRPO stability ([QGallouedec](https://twitter.com/QGallouedec/status/2015711810108973462)).
*   **RL in pretraining (RLP)**: NVIDIA authors announce **RLP (Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective)** accepted to ICLR 2026, framing RL not as “post-training only” but as integrated into pretraining ([ahatamiz1](https://twitter.com/ahatamiz1/status/2015867794626380146)).
*   **Compute reduction via curriculum-like filtering**: AI21’s “Dynamic Data Snoozing” claims up to **3× compute reduction** for RLVR by snoozing examples that are too easy ([DanielGissin](https://twitter.com/DanielGissin/status/2015773616021860522)). If validated, this is a practical recipe: make the sampler policy-aware instead of static.

**Inference infrastructure & dev tooling: vLLM’s “day-0 model support,” VS Code MCP Apps, Cursor subagents**

*   **vLLM’s governance and commercialization pressure**: A long Zhihu-derived summary argues vLLM’s “open-source project → startup” shift was driven by the hidden cost of **day-0 support** (weeks/months of confidential pre-integration per new model), the rise of MoE and heterogeneous inference (fp8/int4/sparse attention), and the mismatch with PyTorch Foundation style testing vs vLLM’s multi-node CI needs. It claims the maintainers founded **Inferact Inc** to fund full-time maintainers while keeping vLLM open-source ([thread](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2015697493288518105)). Related: vLLM shares a practical flag for avoiding OOM on long-context models: `--max-model-len auto` ([vLLM tip](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2015801909316382867)).
*   **MCP Apps: tool calls return interactive UI**: The MCP ecosystem announces **MCP Apps** as the first official MCP extension: tool calls can return **interactive UI components** rendered in-chat. VS Code is first major editor shipping support (Insiders now, stable soon) ([VS Code](https://twitter.com/code/status/2015853688594612715), [alexalbert\_\_](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/2015854375051428111)). Anthropic simultaneously ships “interactive work tools in Claude” (Slack drafting, Figma diagrams, Asana timelines) ([Claude](https://twitter.com/claudeai/status/2015851783655194640)). Net: we’re seeing the “tool interface layer” move from raw JSON to _native UI primitives_ inside agent loops.
*   **Cursor: multi-browser subagents**: Cursor adds multi-browser support via subagents ([Cursor](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/2015863221589049483)), echoing the same direction: parallelized tool execution + better context isolation.

**Kernel LLMs, chip stacks, and “AI for hardware” loops**

*   **GPU MODE 2026: post-training Kernel LLMs in public**: GPU MODE outlines a 2026 plan to **post-train a Kernel LLM** and get generated kernels merged into real repos (PyTorch/vLLM), emphasizing “de-slopify kernels” (determinism, reviewer-mergeable PRs), profiler-guided optimization + memory work, and competitions as evals ([marksaroufim](https://twitter.com/marksaroufim/status/2015818791729746350)).
*   **Microsoft Maia 200**: Microsoft announces Maia 200 as a custom inference accelerator; Mustafa Suleyman claims it’s the most performant first-party hyperscaler silicon, with **3× FP4 performance** vs Trainium v3 and FP8 above TPU v7 ([Mustafa](https://twitter.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2015845567138816326), [follow-up](https://twitter.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2015825111769841744)). Yusuf Mehdi frames this as infra that makes AI “dependable” ([thread](https://twitter.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/2015826703944470701)).
*   **Ricursive Intelligence (AI for chip design)**: Ricursive raises a **$300M Series A** aiming at end-to-end chip design as a recursive self-improvement loop between AI and hardware ([company](https://twitter.com/RicursiveAI/status/2015804806384755059), [Anna Goldie](https://twitter.com/annadgoldie/status/2015806107470438685)).

**Safety, misuse, and societal impact (selected items with direct technical relevance)**

*   **Elicitation attacks via benign chemistry data**: Anthropic reports that fine-tuning open models on “benign” chemical synthesis content generated by frontier models can significantly increase capability on **chemical weapons** tasks—an “elicitation attack” that scales with frontier model strength ([AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2015870963792142563), [paper link](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2015870975238406600)).
*   **Dario Amodei’s “Adolescence of Technology” essay**: A major, highly engaged post argues AI is entering an accelerating feedback loop (AI building AI), with risks spanning misuse, power-seeking autonomy, and economic disruption; it also explicitly frames wealth concentration as a society-breaking failure mode ([Dario](https://twitter.com/DarioAmodei/status/2015833046327402527)). Reaction ranges from strong endorsement to critique of how “takeover risk” framing is presented ([Ryan Greenblatt](https://twitter.com/RyanPGreenblatt/status/2015869503385772037)).
*   **Agent security in practice**: Multiple posts treat desktop/browser agents as inherently high-risk until prompt injection and sandboxing mature, reinforcing the need for strict isolation, least privilege, and careful handling of credentials ([Miessler](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/2015865548714975475)).

*   **WAN 2.6 Walks In (With Upload Woes)**: LM Arena added **wan2.6‑t2i** (text‑to‑image) and **wan2.6‑image** (image edit) to the image arena: [LM Arena — Image Chat](https://lmarena.ai/c/new?chat-modality=image). Users noted **wan2.6‑image** requires an uploaded image and that **wan2.6‑t2i** currently lacks image‑upload support.
    
    *   Staff acknowledged the **upload gap** and are working to enable image uploads for **wan2.6‑t2i**. Builders suggested testing edit pipelines where **masking**, **prompt strength**, and **seed control** align with Arena scoring to benchmark edit fidelity.
*   **Devstral Duels and Text Titans**: The **Code Arena** now features **devstral‑2** for head‑to‑head comparisons—see [LM Arena — Code Arena Direct Battle](https://lmarena.ai/c/new?chat-modality=code&mode=direct-battle). On the text side, **qwen3‑max‑thinking** and **molmo‑2‑8b** joined the lineup: [LM Arena — Text Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?chat-modality=chat).
    
    *   Engineers are probing **reasoning traces** and **tool‑using prompts** to stress **code synthesis** and **refactor quality** under tight token budgets. Early chatter favored task‑specific evaluations (e.g., **SWE‑style bug‑fix** vs. **ground‑up implementation**) to surface model deltas.
*   **Hunyuan Hits the Leaderboard**: Tencent’s **Hunyuan‑Image‑3.0‑Instruct** ranks **#7** on LM Arena’s image‑edit board—see [LM Arena — Image Edit Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/image-edit)—after a launch post: [Tencent Hunyuan announces HunyuanImage 3.0‑Instruct](https://xcancel.com/TencentHunyuan/status/2015635861833167074). The model touts an **80B MoE**, **Native CoT**, and **MixGRPO** for tighter intent alignment.
    
    *   Creators emphasized edit controllability and multi‑image fusion, while evaluators asked for **masking robustness**, **text fidelity**, and **artifact rates** under compositional prompts. Teams plan to pit it against **WAN 2.6** variants using the Arena’s standardized edit tasks.

**4\. Safety, Reliability, and Hallucination Hardening**

*   **Clamp the Chaos: Layer‑Native Safety**: **Layer‑Native Safety Clamping** proposes learning activation‑space **harm directions** and clamping them to block jailbreaks, with a **10K‑pair** dataset at [Pacific‑Prime/safety\_dataset (HF)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pacific-Prime/safety_dataset) and the paper on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/18359832). Authors argue in‑model clamping can’t be bypassed via prompt manipulation.
    
    *   Red‑teamers liked the idea of **activation‑level controls** versus brittle prompt filters, but pressed for tests against **tool‑use** and **multi‑turn** attacks. Expect follow‑ups measuring side effects on **helpfulness**, **coding accuracy**, and **false positives** under adversarial prompting.
*   **Symbolic Sanity Checks Stop Slip‑Ups**: Hybrid approaches check **logical consistency** for math/code/simple facts, as shown in [Consistency Checking for LLMs (arXiv:2409.13724)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13724), while broader consistency remains tough per [Scaling Consistency Beyond Formal Domains (arXiv:2507.10624)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624). Eleuther discussions framed this as practical **hallucination reduction** via **symbolic/deductive layers**.
    
    *   Builders reported wins when pairing **symbolic checkers** with **tool‑augmented prompts**, cautioning that _coverage gaps_ appear outside formal domains. The consensus: start with **code/math** guardrails, then expand to **factual QA** with curated KBs and provenance scoring.

**5\. Agent Tooling and Reasoning Workflows Mature**

*   **Levante Leads with MCP‑Native Workspace**: **Levante** launched an open‑source **MCP‑native AI workspace** for local models (e.g., **Ollama**) with a modular UI—download at [Levante](https://www.levanteapp.com). Engineers highlighted easier **tool wiring**, **local privacy**, and **composable panes** for rapid agent iteration.
    
    *   Early users framed it as a practical hub for **tool‑calling** and **filesystem ops** without cloud dependence. Teams plan to benchmark **context bloat** and **tool discoverability** patterns versus conventional agent shells.
*   **RLM Riffs: AsyncReview + Skills Pack**: AsyncFuncAI open‑sourced **AsyncReview**, a **DSPy RLM** code‑review agent at [AsyncReview (GitHub)](https://github.com/AsyncFuncAI/AsyncReview), and a skills kit landed on npm as [@unravel‑tech/rlm‑skills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unravel-tech/rlm-skills). This pairs **reasoning‑first prompting** with drop‑in **skills** to extend models.
    
    *   Contributors reported smoother **trace inspection** and **optimizer‑guided** prompt tuning for multi‑step modules. One practitioner noted that _rejecting premature answers_ in the metric is key for reliable **RLM** fine‑tuning.
*   **Agents Auto‑Assemble a Browser Engine**: **FastRender**—a browser rendering engine—was built using **2,000 AI coding agents**, documented by Simon Willison in [FastRender: built by 2,000 agents](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/23/fastrender/). The project demonstrates **task decomposition**, **verification**, and **orchestration** at non‑trivial software scale.
    
    *   Engineers debated handoff granularity and _spec‑to‑test loops_ needed to keep multi‑agent pipelines from drifting. The case study strengthens the argument that **agentic coding** can target complex infra when coupled with **strict eval harnesses** and **artifact gating**.

    *   They cited potential driver problems and long lead times as factors.
*   **DistinctionBench defends against data defense**: The discussion of **Between Circuits and Chomsky: Pre-pretraining on Formal Languages Imparts Linguistic Biases** pondered whether **DistinctionBench** might be used as a training target for language models.
    *   A member joked, _'all good evals are training targets ;)'_, but acknowledged that it is _'very contamination resistant'_ due to its endless representational variants.
*   **Hybrid Architectures Halt Hallucinations?**: The group investigated **hybrid architectures** combining **LLMs** with **symbolic/deductive layers** for hallucination reduction.
    *   While checking logical consistency is relatively easy for math, code, and simple facts ([this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13724)), it remains challenging for other types of consistency ([this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624)).
*   **Attention Arrived Before Transformers Transformed**: In **Eleuther ▷ #general**, attention mechanisms were in use on top of RNNs in **2014-2015**, two years before the transformers were invented.
    *   Members proposed that the slower adoption might be because fewer people were working in the field, and **Kaggle** results really catalyzed its widespread adoption.
*   **Symbolic Sanity Checks saves Sanity**: Members debated whether **LLMs** with **symbolic/deductive layers** might reduce hallucinations by checking logical consistency, especially for code and math as shown in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13724).
    *   However, they noted that checking for other types of consistency remains challenging as shown in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624).

*   **Exploring Agentic AI Self-Replication Benchmarks**: A member proposed a **self-replication benchmark** for **agentic AI**, suggesting the agent should either download itself or retrain from scratch and adapt to a target machine.
    *   They also suggested that adapting to a target machine, or even designing one, could be more engaging than simply using existing transformer libraries.
*   **LLM Worms Concept Emerges**: A member jokingly suggested an **LLM worm** benchmark where an LLM is prompted with _"hey make more of you"_ and provided the tools to replicate itself using scripts and API keys.
    *   Another member emphasized the importance of considering resource constraints like **VRAM** to make the challenge more practical and interesting.
*   **Trouble Brewing with MoE Run Dashboard**: A member reported a _'Failed to fetch'_ error in the dashboard while monitoring the progress of an active **MoE run (moe-10b-a1b-8k-wsd-lr3e4-1t)**.
    *   Another member suggested waiting a few hours before checking again, implying a potential temporary issue.
*   **Raytracer Test Causes Local Models to Stumble**: A member observed that local code models (suitable for a **5090**) are struggling with a **raytracer test** from [cpldcpu/llmbenchmark](https://github.com/cpldcpu/llmbenchmark/tree/master/10_raytracer#readme), with even recent models on **lmarena** failing.
    *   Specifically, the smaller models often incorrectly generate the vector class, presenting a persistent challenge.
*   **Semantica Project Needs Helping Hands**: A member introduced [Semantica](https://github.com/Hawksight-AI/semantica), an **open-source project** building semantic infrastructure for **domain-grounded AI**, including **knowledge graphs**, **ontologies**, and **reasoning layers**, and is actively seeking contributors.
    *   They are looking for contributions in areas such as **ontology & schema design**, **knowledge graph modeling**, and **LLM + symbolic / rule-based reasoning**, and even small PRs, feedback, design discussions and issues are all welcome.

*   **EBMs Spark Debate vs. Classical Feedforward**: A discussion comparing **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)** and classical **feedforward networks** debates whether **EBMs** are inherently superior, especially regarding **Shannon entropy** or **Kolmogorov complexity**.
    *   It was suggested that _validation is easier than generation_ in EBMs, relating it to **computational complexity theory (P vs NP)**, while emphasizing the need for a well-defined loss landscape for EBM optimization to work effectively.
*   **LLM Pre-training: Domain-Specific vs. Foundational Faceoff**: A member inquired about the effectiveness of **continued pre-training** a foundational **LLM** (specifically **OLMO-7B**) for a domain-specific task like cheminformatics using the **ZINC20 dataset**.
    *   The goal is to compare results against a domain-specific transformer model, but no specific answers or resources were provided.
*   **MCMC Sampling Suffers Mode-Switching Struggles**: Concerns were raised about the ability of **MCMC** to traverse between spatially separated modes when dimension increases, referencing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11232).
    *   One member argues that **MCMC** tries to emulate flow models due to the latter's superiority, while **EBMs**, contrarily, attempt to make **NNs** more like **MCMC**.
*   **ZKPs: Crypto Signing or Network Traffic Savior?**: Discussion covered using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** for verifying encrypted network traffic and matrix multiplications, citing a [Gemini correspondence](https://gemini.google.com/share/ddfc0ffcb33e) for a matrix low knowledge proof.
    *   While one member proposed a use case in _zero-knowledge “made by humans” proofs_, another member questioned the practicality of **ZKPs**, suggesting breaking the encryption might be cheaper.
*   **LLMs Cyber Skills Face Scrutiny**: A member questioned whether LLMs could develop strong _cyber capabilities_, referencing a [GPTZero article](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/).
    *   Another member doubted LLM companies' ability to address _internal vulnerabilities_, suggesting they fix those before pursuing cyber skills, also citing a [ScienceAlert article](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-waves-that-define-the-limits-of-you) and a [tweet](https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015401219746128322).

*   **Luminal Finds Flash Attention via Bruteforce**: **Luminal** is claiming to find **flash attention** using **bruteforce** on an egraph, taking hours to find, and they explicitly added `exp(x - new_max) = exp(x - old_max) × exp(old_max - new_max)` as a rewrite rule.
    *   The poster reproduced the graphviz shown in the presentations from commit `0bd3b80c`, noting that their minimal set of rewrite rules could transform a naive attention kernel graph into the known **flash attention kernel graph** in 52s on a 9800x3d.
*   **Metal Textures Trounce Buffers for Blurring**: Profiling access speed on **Metal** using `Tensor` with size **512/1024/2048/8192** images as input for a **3/5/7** sized blur kernel showed textures outperforming buffers.
    *   It might be worth throwing in a branching condition depending on the size of the buffer input, [tests results are attached](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068976834928193609/1464679423029547172/Screenshot_2026-01-25_at_1.49.57_AM.png?ex=6978fb82&is=6977aa02&hm=5530b74c4fce9dad5d85a4d9e7409c3809a7ee51ee548744a1fa3deb2efea1d3&).
*   **Tenstorrent Backend Triumphs in Ops Tests**: The **Tenstorrent** backend is passing all ops tests on wormhole or blackhole and there is a [$1k bounty](https://x.com/corsix/status/1880384044728480206) for this milestone.
    *   Someone asked if the bounty requires all test ops test passing on **testorrent hardware**.
