Between 5/17 and 5/20/2024, key AI updates include **Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash models**, featuring sparse multimodal MoE architecture with up to **10M context** and a dense Transformer decoder that is **3x faster and 10x cheaper**. **Yi AI released Yi-1.5 models** with extended context windows of **32K and 16K tokens**. Other notable releases include **Kosmos 2.5 (Microsoft), PaliGemma (Google), Falcon 2, DeepSeek v2 lite, and HunyuanDiT diffusion model**. Research highlights feature an **Observational Scaling Laws paper** predicting model performance across families, a **Layer-Condensed KV Cache** technique boosting inference throughput by **up to 26×**, and the **SUPRA method** converting LLMs into RNNs for reduced compute costs. Hugging Face expanded local AI capabilities enabling on-device AI without cloud dependency. LangChain updated its v0.2 release with improved documentation. The community also welcomed a new LLM Finetuning Discord by Hamel Husain and Dan Becker for Maven course users. \*"Hugging Face is profitable, or close to profitable,"\* enabling $10 million in free shared GPUs for developers.
