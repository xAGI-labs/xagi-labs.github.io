**Meta AI** has released **Llama 3.1**, including a **405B parameter model** that triggers regulatory considerations like the **EU AI Act** and **SB 1047**. The model incorporates extensive **synthetic data** techniques for **code**, **math**, **multilinguality**, **long context**, and **tool use** fine-tuning, with **RLHF** using synthetic preference data from **Llama 2**. The launch was coordinated across major inference providers, with **Groq** demonstrating **750 tokens per second** inference speed and **Fireworks** leading in pricing. The updated license explicitly allows synthetic data generation, marking a significant step in open frontier-class LLMs and cost-efficiency improvements since March.
