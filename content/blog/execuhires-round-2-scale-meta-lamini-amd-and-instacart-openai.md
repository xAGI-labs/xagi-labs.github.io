**Meta** hires **Scale AI's Alexandr Wang** to lead its new "Superintelligence" division following a **$15 billion investment** for a 49% stake in Scale. **Lamini's Sharon Zhou** joins **AMD** as VP of AI under Lisa Su, while **Instacart's Fidji Simo** becomes CEO of Apps at **OpenAI** under **Sama**. **Meta** offers over **$10 million/year compensation packages** to top researchers, successfully recruiting **Jack Rae** from **Gemini**. **OpenAI** releases **o3-pro** model to **ChatGPT Pro** users and API, outperforming **o3** and setting new benchmarks like **Extended NYT Connections** and **SnakeBench**. Despite being slower than **o1-pro**, **o3-pro** excels in reasoning and complex problem-solving. **OpenAI** cuts **o3** pricing by **80%**, making it cheaper than **GPT-4o** and pressuring competitors like **Google** and **Anthropic** to lower prices. Users can now fine-tune the **GPT-4.1** family using **direct preference optimization (DPO)** for subjective tasks.
