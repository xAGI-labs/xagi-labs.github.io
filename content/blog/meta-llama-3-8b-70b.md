**Meta** partially released **Llama 3** models including **8B** and **70B** variants, with a **400B** variant still in training, touted as the first GPT-4 level open-source model. **Stability AI** launched **Stable Diffusion 3 API** with model weights coming soon, showing competitive realism against **Midjourney V6**. **Boston Dynamics** unveiled an electric humanoid robot **Atlas**, and **Microsoft** introduced the **VASA-1** model generating lifelike talking faces at 40fps on RTX 4090. **Mistral AI**, a European OpenAI rival, is seeking $5B funding with its **Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1** model achieving 100% accuracy on 64K context benchmarks. AI safety discussions include calls from former OpenAI board member **Helen Toner** for audits of top AI companies, and the **Mormon Church** released AI usage principles. New AI development tools include **Ctrl-Adapter** for diffusion models, **Distilabel 1.0.0** for synthetic dataset pipelines, **Data Bonsai** for data cleaning with LLMs, and **Dendron** for building LLM agents with behavior trees. Memes highlight AI development humor and cultural references. The release of **Llama 3** models features improved reasoning, a 128K token vocabulary, 8K token sequences, and grouped query attention.
