**Meta** released **Apollo**, a new family of state-of-the-art video-language models available in **1B, 3B, and 7B** sizes, featuring "Scaling Consistency" for efficient scaling and introducing **ApolloBench**, which speeds up video understanding evaluation by **41×** across five temporal perception categories. **Google Deepmind** launched **Veo 2**, a 4K video generation model with improved physics and camera control, alongside an enhanced **Imagen 3** image model. **OpenAI** globally rolled out ChatGPT search with advanced voice and map features and discussed a potential $2,000/month "ChatGPT Max" tier. Research highlights include achieving **Llama 70B** performance using **Llama 3B** via test-time compute scaling and expanding **Command R7B** language support from 10 to 23 languages. Industry updates feature **Figure AI** delivering humanoid robots commercially and **Klarna** reducing workforce through AI. Notion integrated **Cohere Rerank** for better search. Studies reveal LLMs can recognize their own writing style and show self-preference bias. Discussions note video processing progress outpacing text due to better signal-per-compute and data evaluation.
