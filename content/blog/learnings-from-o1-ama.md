**OpenAI** released the **o1 model series**, touted as their "most capable and aligned models yet," trained with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning. The **o1-preview** model scored **21% on ARC-AGI**, **~80% on aider code editing** (surpassing Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 77%), and **~52% on Cognition-Golden**, showcasing a shift from memorizing answers to memorizing reasoning. The model employs a unique chain-of-thought approach enabling "System II thinking" for better problem-solving. Experts like **Andrew Mayne** advise framing o1 as a smart friend providing thoughtful explanations. Additionally, an advanced RAG course sponsored by **Weights & Biases**, **Cohere**, and **Weaviate** offers strategies for hybrid search and prompting to optimize AI solutions.
