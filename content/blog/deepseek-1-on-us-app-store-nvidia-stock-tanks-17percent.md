**DeepSeek** has made a significant cultural impact by hitting mainstream news unexpectedly in 2025. The **DeepSeek-R1** model features a massive **671B parameter MoE architecture** and demonstrates **chain-of-thought (CoT)** capabilities comparable to **OpenAI's o1** at a lower cost. The **DeepSeek V3** model trains a **236B parameter model 42% faster** than its predecessor using **fp8 precision**. The **Qwen2.5** multimodal models support images and videos with sizes ranging from **3B to 72B parameters**, featuring strong vision and agentic capabilities. **LangChain** and **LangGraph** integration enable AI chatbots with memory and tool use, including applications like the **DeFi Agent**. Discussions highlight **NVIDIA's** role in hardware acceleration, with concerns about stock drops due to **DeepSeek's** efficiency and market fears. The compute demand is expected to rise despite efficiency gains, driven by inference scaling and MoE design improvements.
