**OpenAI** has released the **o1** model family, including **o1-preview** and **o1-mini**, focusing on test-time reasoning with extended output token limits over 30k tokens. The models show strong performance, ranking in the 89th percentile on competitive programming, excelling in USA Math Olympiad qualifiers, and surpassing PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and chemistry benchmarks. Notably, **o1-mini** performs impressively despite its smaller size compared to **gpt-4o**. The release highlights new scaling laws for test-time compute that scale loglinearly. Additionally, **Nvidia** is reportedly losing AI chip market share to startups, with a shift in developer preference from CUDA to **llama** models for web development, though Nvidia remains dominant in training. This news reflects significant advances in reasoning-focused models and shifts in AI hardware competition.
