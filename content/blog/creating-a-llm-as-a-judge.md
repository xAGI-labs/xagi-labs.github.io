**Anthropic** released details on Claude 3.5 SWEBench+SWEAgent, while **OpenAI** introduced SimpleQA and **DeepMind** launched NotebookLM. **Apple** announced new M4 Macbooks, and a new SOTA image model, Recraft v3, emerged. Hamel Husain presented a detailed 6,000-word treatise on creating LLM judges using a method called **critique shadowing** to align LLMs with domain experts, addressing the problem of untrusted and unused data in AI teams. The workflow involves expert-reviewed datasets and iterative prompt refinement. Additionally, **Zep** introduced a temporal knowledge graph memory layer to improve AI agent memory and reduce hallucinations. **Anthropic** also integrated Claude 3.5 Sonnet with GitHub Copilot, expanding access to Copilot Chat users.
