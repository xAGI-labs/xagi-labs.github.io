**LMSys** is enhancing LLM evaluation by categorizing performance across **8 query subcategories** and **7 prompt complexity levels**, revealing uneven strengths in models like **Llama-3-70b**. **DeepMind** released **AlphaFold 3**, advancing molecular structure prediction with holistic modeling of protein-DNA-RNA complexes, impacting biology and genetics research. **OpenAI** introduced the **Model Spec**, a public standard to clarify model behavior and tuning, inviting community feedback and aiming for models to learn directly from it. **Llama 3** has reached top leaderboard positions on LMSys, nearly matching **Claude-3-sonnet** in performance, with notable variations on complex prompts. The analysis highlights the evolving landscape of model benchmarking and behavior shaping.
