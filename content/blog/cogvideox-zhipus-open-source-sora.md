**Zhipu AI**, Alibaba's AI arm and China's 3rd largest AI lab, released the open 5B video generation model **CogVIdeoX**, which can run without GPUs via their ChatGLM web and desktop apps. **Meta AI** announced trust & safety research and CyberSecEval 3 alongside the release of **Llama 3.1**, with **Llama 3 405B** now available serverless on Google Cloud Vertex AI and Hugging Face x NVIDIA NIM API. Updates include **Moondream**, an open vision-language model improving DocVQA and TextVQA tasks, and the lightweight MoE chat model **Phi-3.5** with 16x3.8B parameters. **Together Compute** introduced the Rerank API featuring Salesforce's **LlamaRank** model for document and code ranking. Research highlights include superposition prompting for RAG without fine-tuning, the AgentWrite pipeline for long-form content generation over 20,000 words, and a comparison showing Long Context methods outperform RAG at higher costs. Tools include Not Diamond, an AI model router, AI command line interfaces, and an open-source WebGPU background removal tool. \*"You don't even need GPUs to run it,"\* referring to CogVIdeoX.
