**Jan Leike** is launching a new grant initiative inspired by **Patrick Collison's Fast Grants** to support AI research. **OpenAI** introduced a new developers Twitter handle @OpenAIDevs for community updates. Discussions on **OpenAI's Gemini** and **Bard** chatbots highlight their ability to read each other's instructions and offer unique coding solutions.
