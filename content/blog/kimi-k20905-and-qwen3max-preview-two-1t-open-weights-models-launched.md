**Moonshot AI** updated their **Kimi K2-0905** open model with doubled context length to **256k tokens**, improved coding and tool-calling, and integration with agent scaffolds. **Alibaba** released **Qwen 3 Max**, a **1 trillion parameter** model with agent-oriented behavior, available via **Qwen Chat**, **Alibaba Cloud API**, and **OpenRouter**. The community highlights China's dominance in open models and debates around meaningful evaluation methods for code agents, emphasizing long-horizon and domain-specific evals. Influential voices like **@swyx** and **@karpathy** discuss the importance of practical evals and discriminator models for ranking outputs.
