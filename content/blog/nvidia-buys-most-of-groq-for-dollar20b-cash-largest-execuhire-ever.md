**Groq** leadership team is joining **Nvidia** under a "non-exclusive licensing agreement" in a deal valued at **$20 billion cash**, marking a major acquisition in AI chip space though Nvidia states it is not acquiring Groq as a company. Jensen Huang plans to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture to enhance AI inference and real-time workloads. Twitter highlights include **Gemini** used as a consumer utility for calorie tracking, OpenAI discussing the "deployment gap" focusing on model usage in healthcare and business, and Tesla's FSD v14 described as a "Physical Turing Test" for consumer AI. Benchmarking challenges are noted by **Epoch AI** emphasizing provider variance and integration issues affecting model quality measurement. Discussions on coding agents and developer experience convergence continue in the AI community.
