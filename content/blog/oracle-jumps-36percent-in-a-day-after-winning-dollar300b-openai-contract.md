**Oracle's OCI division** reported a stunning **+359% revenue bookings growth to $455B** with cloud revenue guidance of **$144B by 2030**, driven significantly by a large deal with **OpenAI** amid tensions with **Microsoft**. On AI infrastructure, **Moonshot AI** released **Kimi’s checkpoint-engine**, enabling rapid weight updates on 1T-parameter models across thousands of GPUs, integrating with **vLLM**. **RLFactory** introduced a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for tool-using agents, showing smaller models outperforming larger ones. **TRL v0.23** added context parallelism for long-context training. **Thinking Machines Lab** published research on deterministic inference pipelines, making **vLLM** deterministic for **Qwen** models. **Meta** launched **BackendBench**, a PyTorch benchmarking tool.
