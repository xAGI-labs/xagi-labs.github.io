**Stripe** launched their Agent SDK, enabling AI-native shopping experiences like **Perplexity Shopping** for US Pro members, featuring one-click checkout and free shipping via the **Perplexity Merchant Program**. **Mistral AI** released the **Pixtral Large 124B** multi-modal image model, now on **Hugging Face** and supported by **Le Chat** for image generation. **Cerebras Systems** offers a public inference endpoint for **Llama 3.1 405B** with a 128k context window and high throughput. **Claude 3.6** shows improvements over **Claude 3.5** but with subtle hallucinations. The **Bi-Mamba** 1-bit architecture improves LLM efficiency. The **wandb SDK** is preinstalled on Google Colab, and **Pixtral Large** is integrated into **AnyChat** and supported by **vLLM** for efficient model usage.
