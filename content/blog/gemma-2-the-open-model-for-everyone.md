**Gemma 2**, a **27B** parameter model from **google-deepmind**, was released with innovations like 1:1 local-global attention alternation and logit soft-capping, leveraging **knowledge distillation** to train smaller models on over 50× the compute-optimal token quantity. The model supports multilingual and multimodal capabilities, with fine-tuning success on over 200 Indic language variants. The **Open LLM Leaderboard** highlights **alibaba's Qwen 72B** as the top model, with **mistral-ai's Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct** also ranking highly. **Anthropic** launched **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, improving intelligence at mid-tier cost and speed. Research on eliminating matrix multiplication in LLMs promises significant memory savings without performance loss. \*Kathleen Kenealy\* and \*Daniel Han\* provided insights on Gemma 2's tokenizer and attention scaling respectively.
