**Project Obsidian** is a multimodal model being trained publicly, tracked by **Teknium** on the Nous Discord. Discussions include **4M: Massively Multimodal Masked Modeling** and **Reason.dev**, a TypeScript framework for LLM applications. The **OpenAI Discord** community discussed hardware specs for running **TensorFlow JS** for image detection, security API ideas for filtering inappropriate images, and concerns about racial and cultural bias in AI, especially in facial recognition and healthcare. Challenges with **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4** in word puzzle games were noted, along with GPU recommendations prioritizing VRAM for AI inference. Users also debated **GPT-4**'s vision capabilities, limitations of **DALL·E 3**, platform access issues, and prompting strategies for better outputs.
