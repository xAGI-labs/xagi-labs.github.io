**Top Story: Microsoft Build recap, and new MAI model technical details**

What happened
-------------

**Microsoft used Build to position itself as both an AI platform company and a frontier-model lab, pairing broad product launches with unusually detailed disclosures about its new MAI model family.**

*   Microsoft AI announced **seven new MAI models** spanning reasoning, code, image, speech transcription, and voice, led by **MAI-Thinking-1**, **MAI-Code-1-Flash**, **MAI-Image-2.5**, **MAI-Transcribe-1.5**, and **MAI-Voice-2** according to [@MicrosoftAI](https://x.com/MicrosoftAI/status/2061887500541366489) and [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   The flagship reasoning model **MAI-Thinking-1** was presented as Microsoft’s **first reasoning model**, built with **clean data lineage** and **zero distillation from third-party models** in posts from [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188), [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2061878701823066431), [@tuhinone](https://x.com/tuhinone/status/2061879239817969756), and [@HannaHajishirzi](https://x.com/HannaHajishirzi/status/2061901432627044430)
*   Microsoft released a **109-page technical report** for MAI-Thinking-1, which drew strong positive reactions from technically oriented readers for its level of transparency, including [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061877335960281459), [@ethanCaballero](https://x.com/ethanCaballero/status/2061920873297088723), [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062013300196700395), [@yacinelearning](https://x.com/yacinelearning/status/2061914159235617056), and [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061916808626815161)
*   Microsoft also emphasized **local AI and agent-native Windows**: Build messaging highlighted **secure execution layers for agents**, a new **Surface RTX Spark Dev Box**, Windows AI access to the broader Windows GPU install base, and concept hardware such as **Project Solara/Scout**, summarized by [@yusuf\_i\_mehdi](https://x.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/2061882543641907528), [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061865165734506683), [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061860319547527191), and [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061875714933371220)
*   Build also included a major **GitHub Copilot app** push as the “desktop home for agent-native software development,” with **canvases**, cross-device continuity, and tighter GitHub agent workflows, from [@pierceboggan](https://x.com/pierceboggan/status/2061868635241828688), [@lukehoban](https://x.com/lukehoban/status/2061905434039246939), and reactions from [@techgirl1908](https://x.com/techgirl1908/status/2061870470237164018)
*   Microsoft introduced **Web IQ**, a new grounding/search API stack for AI agents, claiming the APIs already power “nearly all AI agents and chatbots in the industry today, including Copilot and ChatGPT,” via [@JordiRib1](https://x.com/JordiRib1/status/2061866606670581871)
*   Satya Nadella framed Build as an ecosystem moment rather than a single-product launch, while Mustafa Suleyman framed it as the output of Microsoft’s internal “hill-climbing machine,” in [@satyanadella](https://x.com/satyanadella/status/2061896503304806521), [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061934667096596657), and reaction from [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2061983583523475556)

MAI model family: disclosed facts and technical details
-------------------------------------------------------

### MAI-Thinking-1

*   Microsoft described **MAI-Thinking-1** as a **35B active parameter MoE** with a **256K context window** in [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   A separate summary from [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061889624847343825) says the model is a **1T@35B parameter model**, **pre-trained on 30T tokens**, and trained using **8192 GB200 GPUs**; this appears to be a reading of the technical report rather than Microsoft marketing copy
*   [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061877528781025381) similarly summarized it as a **mid-size MoE with 45B active params**, but this conflicts with Mustafa’s own **35B active** figure; the more authoritative figure in the tweet set is the official **35B active** number
*   Microsoft claims **97% on AIME 2025** and **53% on SWE-Bench Pro**, with blind human raters on Surge preferring it overall to **Sonnet 4.6**, from [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188) and [@asadovsky](https://x.com/asadovsky/status/2062008312603070891)
*   Microsoft says the model is **optimized on MAIA 200**, with **30% better performance per dollar** and **1.4x performance-per-watt gain** versus **GB200** when running MAI models end-to-end, per [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   Microsoft and partners repeatedly stressed **no third-party distillation**, “clean data lineage,” and enterprise-controlled fine-tuning with “100% eyes-off” post-training data through Baseten, in [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2061878701823066431), [@tuhinone](https://x.com/tuhinone/status/2061879239817969756), and [@MicrosoftAI](https://x.com/MicrosoftAI/status/2061923309344756043)

### MAI-Code-1-Flash

*   Microsoft introduced **MAI-Code-1-Flash** as a fast coding model for **VS Code** and **GitHub Copilot CLI**, first announced by [@pierceboggan](https://x.com/pierceboggan/status/2061877165810131297) and later highlighted by [@mariorod1](https://x.com/mariorod1/status/2061914993550143513)
*   Official Microsoft messaging via [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188) says **Code-1-Flash achieves 51% on SWE-Bench Pro despite having just 5B parameters**, positioning it near Haiku-class size/cost
*   A competing summary from [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061891478176112794) describes it as a **137B parameter MoE**, **256K context**, trained on **10T+ tokens**, and “stronger and more efficient than Claude 4.5 Haiku.” That likely indicates **5B active parameters** rather than total parameters; the tweets do not fully reconcile this distinction, but together imply **small active footprint within a much larger MoE**
*   Availability at launch was highlighted as **GitHub Copilot / VS Code-first**, per [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061891478176112794) and [@mariorod1](https://x.com/mariorod1/status/2061914993550143513)

### MAI-Image-2.5

*   Microsoft launched **MAI-Image-2.5** and a **Flash** variant, claiming both reached **#2 on leaderboards**, with [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188) saying they surpass **Nano Banana 2** on image editing
*   Independent leaderboard accounts supported the high ranking: [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2061887242579382660) reported **#2 in Image Edit Arena** with **score 1401**, **+10 points over Nano Banana 2**, Grok Imagine, and ChatGPT Image Latest HF
*   [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2061894541888962712) further said MAI-Image-2.5 “advances the Pareto frontier,” meaning no model at its price tier scores higher on that benchmark
*   Distribution partners quickly followed, including [@OpenRouter](https://x.com/OpenRouter/status/2061894672847671724) and [@fal](https://x.com/fal/status/2061920052664820199)

### MAI-Transcribe-1.5

*   [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2061878491860324402) reported **MAI-Transcribe-1.5** as an unusually strong speed/accuracy point on the STT frontier: **~276x realtime**, **2.4% AA-WER**, **#3 overall** on its leaderboard
*   The model supports **43 languages**, including English, French, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese, and supports **keyword biasing** for rarer terms such as names and medical terminology, per [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2061878491860324402)
*   Pricing was reported as **$6 per 1,000 minutes of audio** via Microsoft Foundry in [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2061878498609053909)
*   OpenRouter also listed the model among the three MAI launches it brought live the same day in [@OpenRouter](https://x.com/OpenRouter/status/2061894672847671724)

### MAI-Voice-2

*   MAI-Voice-2 appears in Microsoft’s “seven models” umbrella and in OpenRouter’s availability post at [@OpenRouter](https://x.com/OpenRouter/status/2061894672847671724)
*   The tweet set contains little technical detail on Voice-2 itself beyond launch/availability

Technical-report details that mattered to researchers
-----------------------------------------------------

### Why the report stood out

*   The dominant technical reaction was that Microsoft released an unusually detailed frontier-model report: [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947) called it “one of the most transparent for a model at this scale,” [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062023547690828141) said it “could really serve as an updated textbook for LLM training today,” and [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061879506139557979) called it a “gold mine”
*   Multiple readers highlighted that the report disclosed **pipeline details, scaling ladder methodology, data curation, infra metrics, and MFU numbers**; this level of specificity is what drew praise from [@ethanCaballero](https://x.com/ethanCaballero/status/2061920873297088723), [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2062004670017486912), and [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062013300196700395)

### Pretraining and data

*   A major technical claim repeated across commentary is that MAI-Thinking-1 used **no synthetic data** and **no distillation**, not only in post-training but throughout the disclosed pipeline, from [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947), [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061967095022366924), and [@HannaHajishirzi](https://x.com/HannaHajishirzi/status/2061901432627044430)
*   [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061977834558804207) says the report explicitly notes data from **Common Crawl plus private sources**, with **targeted sub-pipelines for different domains**, heavy extraction/dedup work, and an intentional choice of **no synthetic data**
*   The report’s internal **private NLL set** used for scaling decisions was summarized by [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061976608265880004) as:
    *   **50% code**
    *   **17.5% STEM**
    *   **17.5% math**
    *   **10% general knowledge**
    *   **5% multilingual**
*   [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061976230933496176) says architecture promotion in the scaling ladder was based on an **Efficiency Gain (EG)** metric: how much extra compute the baseline would need to match the candidate’s loss
*   The same thread notes ablations at roughly **100/200 tokens per parameter**, described as around “Chinchilla optimal” for the setup, while also remarking this differs from dense-model heuristics due to MoE structure in [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061975730414633043)

### Post-training / RL

*   The most discussed technical choice was that Microsoft appears to have started RL from a checkpoint with **no prior reasoning exposure**, which several readers found notable. [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061879070141677615) called this a “very interesting decision,” while [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061878066314645861) reacted to graphs suggesting a jump from **<20% AIME25 to >95%**
*   [@HannaHajishirzi](https://x.com/HannaHajishirzi/status/2061901432627044430) described the “climbing from scratch” recipe as **simple recipes, rigorous science, self-distillation, patience, and great infra**
*   [@soldni](https://x.com/soldni/status/2061882085573616003) characterized the process as “climbing with no distillation, like the big boys do”
*   Some independent readers inferred from the report that **synth data remains very valuable** for agentic performance in the broader field, even if Microsoft deliberately avoided it here; see [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061961874879783376)

### Data curation / judges / DSPy GEPA

*   A detail that got substantial attention from the DSPy/late-interaction crowd: Microsoft reportedly used **GEPA / DSPy-optimized LLM judges** in pretraining data curation and quality scoring
*   This was highlighted by [@bj2rn](https://x.com/bj2rn/status/2061941109828301241), [@LakshyAAAgrawal](https://x.com/LakshyAAAgrawal/status/2062013650639241403), and [@lateinteraction](https://x.com/lateinteraction/status/2062015109132873852)

### Infra / utilization / hardware co-design

*   Microsoft reportedly disclosed **exact MFU across iterations**, which multiple readers said is rarely shared at this scale, per [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947)
*   [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061889624847343825) summarized the run as using **8192 GB200 GPUs**
*   [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2062004120098144764) singled out a reported **~40% higher throughput per watt**\-type figure as “pretty impressive and bullish on microsoft chips,” though this may refer to rack-level budget or serving configuration and was not fully unpacked in-tweet
*   Microsoft’s official framing connected model design to **MAIA 200** custom silicon and emphasized better **performance-per-dollar** and **performance-per-watt** vs NVIDIA GB200 in [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   Build’s broader Windows/local-AI narrative also centered on hardware specifics such as:
    *   **1 trillion parameters running locally on DGX Station**
    *   **128GB unified memory**
    *   **110 TOPS AI performance**
    *   **20 CPU cores**
    *   **70+ PowerToys utilities** from [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061852480636653924)
*   Reactions also pointed to local runs of large models, e.g. [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061852979318427988) on **RTX Spark running a 120B parameter model locally**

Build product/platform recap beyond the models
----------------------------------------------

### GitHub Copilot app and agent-native development

*   GitHub unveiled the **GitHub Copilot app**, pitched as a desktop surface for **agent-native software development** by [@pierceboggan](https://x.com/pierceboggan/status/2061868635241828688)
*   Key themes included:
    *   **canvases** for bidirectional work between users and agents, per [@Techmeme](https://x.com/Techmeme/status/2061875738694062419)
    *   continuity across **CLI, mobile, web, local, and cloud**, per [@lukehoban](https://x.com/lukehoban/status/2061905448287322243)
    *   a growing role for GitHub as the center of agent workflows, reflected in [@techgirl1908](https://x.com/techgirl1908/status/2061870470237164018) and [@OrenMe](https://x.com/OrenMe/status/2061873010664001605)
*   Copilot CLI also got an experimental **terminal UI with tabs, built-in feedback/rubber duck, prompt scheduling, and voice input**, per [@GHchangelog](https://x.com/GHchangelog/status/2061870684876272123)

### Windows as an agent runtime

*   Microsoft’s Windows org framed Build around “faster developer execution, a secure execution layer for agents, and unmetered intelligence that runs locally on device,” per [@yusuf\_i\_mehdi](https://x.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/2061882543641907528)
*   Several posts stressed that Microsoft wants **Windows** to be the trusted execution platform for agents, not just Azure
*   [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061865165734506683) described **Project Solara** as a platform for **agent-first devices**, with concepts including:
    *   a **desktop AI companion**
    *   a **wearable badge** with cameras, microphones, sensors, and secure authentication
*   [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061860319547527191) saw these as handheld/desktop devices for controlling agents and compared them to expectations people had for standalone OpenAI hardware
*   [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061875714933371220) separately highlighted **Microsoft Scout** as an “always-on personal agent for work”

### Web IQ and search for agents

*   [@JordiRib1](https://x.com/JordiRib1/status/2061866606670581871) announced **Microsoft Web IQ** as a suite of **AI-native grounding APIs** for **web pages, news, images, and videos**
*   His framing is important context: classic search engines were built for humans, but Microsoft believes future search demand will come from agents, potentially **1000x more queries** than human search traffic
*   He claimed Web IQ was re-architected from Bing’s stack for **quality, latency, and token efficiency**, and that it already powers major chatbots including **Copilot and ChatGPT**

### Foundry and open-model distribution

*   [@jeffboudier](https://x.com/jeffboudier/status/2061868927207244277) said Satya cited **11,000+ models available in Microsoft Foundry**, of which **10,928** come from Hugging Face
*   This supports Microsoft’s parallel identity at Build: both a first-party model builder and a large multi-model hosting/distribution platform

### Build messaging around datacenters and compute

*   Several observers noted Build discussion around **data center expansion**, community backlash, and Microsoft’s argument that AI infra can expand without raising electricity costs to local communities; see [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061854806395015316) and [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061903253890330639)
*   [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061901702324695115) highlighted Mustafa saying AI compute will grow **1000x in the next 3 years**, taking today’s rough **5e27 FLOPs** frontier scale to **5e30 FLOPs by 2029**
*   [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880029315764256) summarized the company’s philosophical theme as **“Humanist superintelligence”**

Facts vs. opinions
------------------

### Factual claims in the tweet set

*   Microsoft launched **seven new MAI models** at Build: [@MicrosoftAI](https://x.com/MicrosoftAI/status/2061887500541366489)
*   Official metrics for MAI-Thinking-1: **35B active MoE**, **256K context**, **97% AIME 2025**, **53% SWE-Bench Pro**, and blind human preference over Sonnet 4.6: [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   Official metrics for MAI-Code-1-Flash: **51% SWE-Bench Pro**, **5B parameters** as stated in tweet copy: [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061880164498428188)
*   MAI-Image-2.5 ranking claims were independently echoed by [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2061887242579382660)
*   MAI-Transcribe-1.5 speed/accuracy details came from independent benchmark account [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2061878491860324402)
*   Microsoft released a **109-page technical report**: [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061877335960281459)

### Opinions / interpretations

*   “Microsoft is training serious models now?” from [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2061892492350407158) is an interpretive reaction to the model/report quality, not a standalone fact
*   Claims that the report is “one of the most transparent” or “an updated textbook” are opinions from [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947) and [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062023547690828141), albeit shared by many readers
*   [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061852480636653924) and [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061865165734506683) framed Build as a strategic shift from cloud-only AI toward local reasoning/agents; that is analysis rather than official wording
*   Posts claiming Microsoft “leaked” Anthropic Mythos FLOPs, including [@swyx](https://x.com/swyx/status/2061878629504881151) and [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061897540161728791), are speculative interpretations of a slide, later contested by the same cluster of commenters

Different opinions and perspectives
-----------------------------------

### Supportive views

*   Technical readers were broadly impressed by the **report’s transparency** and Microsoft’s willingness to publish details usually withheld at this scale: [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947), [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062023547690828141), [@ethanCaballero](https://x.com/ethanCaballero/status/2061920873297088723), [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061916808626815161)
*   Some saw MAI-Thinking-1 as proof Microsoft is becoming a genuine frontier lab rather than just a model reseller or application layer, e.g. [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2061892492350407158), [@echen](https://x.com/echen/status/2061907282607100075), [@NandoDF](https://x.com/NandoDF/status/2061901884042985728)
*   Enterprise/platform supporters liked the **clean-data-lineage**, **fine-tunable**, **eyes-off post-training data** story, especially Baseten/Microsoft’s positioning around ownership and control: [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2061878701823066431), [@tuhinone](https://x.com/tuhinone/status/2061879239817969756)

### Neutral / analytical views

*   Several posts focused on **reading and unpacking the report** rather than cheering the launch, especially [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061916808626815161), [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062013300196700395), and [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947)
*   Some commentators were careful on benchmark interpretation. [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061918020843557110) noted Microsoft appeared to compare to **Sonnet 4.6** generally, with **Opus-level comparability only on SWE Pro**
*   [@iScienceLuvr](https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2061926066453962952) specifically appreciated reporting on **health benchmarks** such as HealthBench Professional and MedXpertQA rather than only coding/math

### Skeptical / opposing views

*   A subset questioned whether all numbers and comparisons were being interpreted correctly, especially around active params and external-model comparisons
*   The most visible skepticism concerned the apparent **Mythos FLOP “leak”**. [@iScienceLuvr](https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2061882397340393514) suggested it was probably just an estimate, not a leak; [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061989029025853757) later argued the original **6.1e27 FLOP** figure was unrealistic and supplied a lower alternative estimate before posting a correction in [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061990840138899674)
*   There was also implicit skepticism in the field about whether **zero synth / zero distillation** is the right long-term recipe for best agentic performance, as noted by readers emphasizing synth-data deltas elsewhere, e.g. [@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2061961874879783376)

Context: why this matters
-------------------------

*   Build’s announcements matter because they suggest Microsoft is no longer content with being only:
    1.  Azure/OpenAI’s cloud host
    2.  GitHub’s developer surface
    3.  Copilot’s application shell  
        It is also trying to be a **first-party frontier model developer** with its own model family, silicon stack, and post-training platform
*   The **clean lineage / no distillation** emphasis is strategically significant. It addresses enterprise concerns around IP provenance, future controllability, and dependence on external labs
*   The **local AI** emphasis matters because Microsoft is tying AI strategy to Windows and device distribution, not just to Azure. Build messaging repeatedly pushed the idea that reasoning models, planners, and agents can increasingly run **on-device**, not only in the cloud: [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061852480636653924), [@yusuf\_i\_mehdi](https://x.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/2061882543641907528)
*   The **109-page report** matters because frontier-model transparency has generally been shrinking, especially around data, infra, and training methodology. Multiple researchers explicitly noted the disclosure level is uncommon at this scale: [@eliebakouch](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2061965825037254947), [@nrehiew\_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2062023547690828141)
*   The Build recap also showed Microsoft trying to integrate all layers of the stack:
    *   **models**: MAI family
    *   **chips**: MAIA 200
    *   **cloud**: Azure + Foundry
    *   **OS**: Windows agent runtime
    *   **developer UX**: Copilot app / VS Code / CLI
    *   **retrieval/grounding**: Web IQ
    *   **hardware form factors**: Solara / Scout concepts
*   This combination is why several observers described the event less as a normal dev conference and more as a coordinated move toward an **agent platform spanning cloud, edge, OS, and custom models**, e.g. [@satyanadella](https://x.com/satyanadella/status/2061896503304806521), [@mustafasuleyman](https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2061934667096596657), and [@TheTuringPost](https://x.com/TheTuringPost/status/2061865165734506683)

The “Mythos FLOPs leak” mini-story
----------------------------------

*   During/after Build, some users claimed a Microsoft slide inadvertently revealed training compute for Anthropic’s rumored **Claude Mythos**, with [@swyx](https://x.com/swyx/status/2061878629504881151) asking if Mustafa had leaked the FLOP count
*   [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061897540161728791) estimated the slide implied **6.1e27 FLOPs** with a confidence interval based on pixel measurement, while [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2061908067034517853) noted that would be around **Gemini 3.1 Pro-scale** compute
*   That interpretation was subsequently challenged by [@iScienceLuvr](https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2061882397340393514), who argued it was probably an estimate, and then by [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061989029025853757), who posted a lower-range model-based estimate of **3.37e26 to 1.46e27 FLOPs** and later said the original numbers were **bogus** in [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2061990840138899674)
*   The episode is useful mostly as context: Build’s compute/scaling messaging was detailed enough that people started trying to infer competitor training budgets from presentation materials

**Developer tools, agents, and coding workflows**

*   OpenAI launched **Sites in Codex**, letting teams turn ideas/docs/plans into deployed internal websites/apps with auth and dynamic data, first for business/enterprise users, in [@OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2061845949170045346), [@TheRohanVarma](https://x.com/TheRohanVarma/status/2061872164442403139), and [@gdb](https://x.com/gdb/status/2061988413105156128)

**Models, local inference, and routing**

*   H Company launched **Holo 3.1**, a local computer-use model family based on Qwen-style architecture, with checkpoints from **0.8B to 35B** and formats including **NVFP4, FP8, and Q4 GGUF**; a popular summary cited **79.3% on AndroidWorld** for the 35B model in [@TeksEdge](https://x.com/TeksEdge/status/2061825310669332818), with launch tweet from [@hcompany\_ai](https://x.com/hcompany_ai/status/2061815355341725925)

*   OpenRouter data shared by [@ttunguz](https://x.com/ttunguz/status/2061846636805177692) showed **open-weight models at 69.1% of token volume**, versus **30.9%** for closed models
*   Commentary around **model routing** as a key future abstraction came from [@ClementDelangue](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/2061871024627482964), [@garrytan](https://x.com/garrytan/status/2061878212213572083), [@matanSF](https://x.com/matanSF/status/2061865185527074914), and the counterpoint from [@glennko](https://x.com/glennko/status/2061896887699964171), who argued enterprise production reliability makes generic routing harder than enthusiasts suggest
*   Local-AI UX improvements also appeared in Hugging Face’s **hardware compatibility checks** and oMLX’s native macOS app release from [@m\_newhaus](https://x.com/m_newhaus/status/2061824017510584630) and [@jundotkim](https://x.com/jundotkim/status/2061863850874634242)

AI Reddit Recap
===============

/r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap
---------------------------------

### 1\. NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra and RTX Spark Specs

*   **[NVIDIA announces Nemotron 3 Ultra](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1tthkh5/nvidia_announces_nemotron_3_ultra/)** (Activity: 669): **The image shows **NVIDIA announcing Nemotron 3 Ultra**, presented as a `550B`\-parameter open-weight model in a “Frontier Smart” benchmark table, with comparisons against **GLM 5.1, Kimi K2.6, and Qwen3.5** across agent productivity, coding, instruction following, and long-context tasks. A commenter clarifies it is likely a **MoE `550B-A55`** model, while another notes its reported “artificial analysis score” of `48`, described as just below “frontier” and roughly in the **MiniMax 2.7** range; image: [https://i.redd.it/f79wu6dnml4h1.jpeg](https://i.redd.it/f79wu6dnml4h1.jpeg).** Commenters appreciated that NVIDIA benchmarked against other open-source/open-weight models, but there was limited technical debate beyond positioning it as potentially the strongest U.S. open-weight model.
    
    *   Commenters identify **NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra** as a **MoE `550B-A55`** model, implying roughly `550B` total parameters with about `55B` active parameters per token. Technical discussion centered on its positioning as a large open-weight mixture-of-experts model rather than a dense frontier-class release.
    *   A benchmark-focused comment cites an **Artificial Analysis score of `48`**, described as “one notch less than frontier” and roughly in the **MiniMax `2.7`** range, while another notes NVIDIA’s comparisons against other open-source/open-weight models. Links shared include NVIDIA’s [Nemotron-3-Ultra-Base usage cookbook](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/tree/main/usage-cookbook/Nemotron-3-Ultra-Base) and the [LifeArchitect models table](https://lifearchitect.ai/models-table/).
    *   There was skepticism about NVIDIA comparing Nemotron 3 Ultra to **Qwen3.5**, with one commenter arguing the comparison was likely chosen to frame it as the “best **open weight**” U.S. model despite losing to stronger non-U.S. or broader frontier competitors. The technical takeaway is that its competitive claim may depend heavily on the subset of models considered: open-weight, U.S.-origin, and benchmark selection.
*   **[RTX Spark does not have 600GB/s Bandwith](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1tu639j/rtx_spark_does_not_have_600gbs_bandwith/)** (Activity: 693): **The slide clarifies that **NVIDIA’s RTX Spark Superchip** does **not** have `600 GB/s` memory bandwidth: its unified memory is listed as **128 GB LPDDR5X at `300 GB/s`**, while `600 GB/s` refers to **NVLINK-C2C** bandwidth between the Blackwell RTX GPU and Grace CPU. The post argues that outlets reporting `600 GB/s` as memory bandwidth misread the Computex slide; the image shows specs including **6144 CUDA cores**, **1 PFLOP FP4 AI performance**, and a **20-core Grace CPU**. [Image](https://i.redd.it/lzttip99mq4h1.png)** Commenters are broadly critical of the product positioning, calling it an overpriced cut-down chip with weak I/O and disputing comparisons to an RTX 5070, with one commenter claiming it is “below a 3060 Ti.” There is also a recurring complaint about NVIDIA’s CUDA lock-in and a desire for more hardware-agnostic alternatives.
    
    *   A commenter argues the reported `600GB/s` bandwidth was likely a media/LLM propagation error, because **GB10/N1/N1X** appear to use the same underlying silicon with only thermal-profile differences. They describe the package as **two dies connected via NVLink on TSMC CoWoS**, where the GPU die has no direct I/O or memory controllers, leaving the CPU die to handle memory and other I/O.
    *   The same technical analysis claims die-edge constraints make higher memory-channel counts implausible: the CPU die edge facing the GPU is consumed by NVLink, leaving only three sides for I/O including memory controllers. Based on the physical “shoreline” required for each `32-bit` memory channel, they estimate the design is limited to **4 memory channels**, matching GB10, with the only likely change being LPDDR speed increasing from `8533 MT/s` to `9500 MT/s`.
    *   One thread frames NVIDIA pricing and positioning as a CUDA lock-in problem, arguing that real competition requires moving away from **CUDA** toward hardware-agnostic software stacks. The commenter speculates that LLM-assisted porting of CUDA-dependent code could eventually reduce NVIDIA’s moat by making alternative accelerators easier to target.

### 2\. Local-First AI Privacy and Censorship Tests

*   **[Minimax M3 appears to have no political censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1tuv1sv/minimax_m3_appears_to_have_no_political_censorship/)** (Activity: 689): **The image ([screenshot](https://i.redd.it/vgkda1ua5w4h1.png)) is **not a meme**; it shows **MiniMax M3** answering a politically sensitive prompt about the **1989 Tiananmen Square protests** with a relatively uncensored summary, including martial law, PLA use of tanks/live ammunition, civilian deaths, international condemnation, and ongoing censorship in China. The post frames this as an outlier in a Chinese/CCP AI-bias benchmark, since the author says other **MiniMax** models exhibit the censorship typical of many Chinese LLMs.** Commenters speculate that MiniMax M3 may be less censored because it is hosted in **Singapore** and may use a _Mistral-style_ setup: an uncensored base model plus an external safety/content filter. Others argue censorship is often geopolitical alignment rather than a binary feature, contrasting this output with refusals or pro-CCP boilerplate from models like **Qwen** and **StepFun**.
    
    *   Several commenters framed Minimax M3’s behavior as likely using a **Mistral-style moderation architecture**: an uncensored base/chat model paired with an external safety or content filter, rather than heavy refusal behavior baked into the model weights. One commenter argued that direct model censorship is resource-intensive and brittle because adversarial or carefully phrased prompts can often bypass safety tuning.
    *   A technically relevant benchmark caveat was raised: any evaluation of **China-related political bias or censorship** should be run in both **English and Chinese**. Commenters noted that response differences may reflect training-data distribution rather than only explicit censorship, and that even Western models can show pronounced language-dependent behavior on politically sensitive topics.
    *   Users compared behavior across models, claiming **Qwen** refused to answer certain Tiananmen-related prompts while **StepFun** produced a strongly pro-PRC denial-style response. The thread suggested testing Minimax M3 with the same prompts in Chinese to determine whether its apparent lack of censorship is consistent across languages or only visible in English.
*   **[Voice dictation should be free, open source, local first](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1ttuv0p/voice_dictation_should_be_free_open_source_local/)** (Activity: 479): ****Freestyle** is launching an early-preview, free/open-source voice dictation app for **macOS, Windows, and Linux**, positioning itself as a privacy-first alternative to paid tools like Wispr Flow by supporting both **cloud ASR** and **local/on-device models** via its GitHub repo: [freestyle-voice/freestyle](https://github.com/freestyle-voice/freestyle). The maintainer’s stated technical target is _“sub-second transcription latency”_ plus strong post-processing to approach premium UX while avoiding server-side capture of all speech/audio.** Commenters noted overlap with existing OSS dictation tools, especially [cjpais/Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy), which also offers post-processing; one argued Freestyle should contribute there instead of duplicating effort. The maintainer countered that existing OSS options have not matched the latency/UX of paid apps, while another commenter preferred Handy’s more invisible menu-bar-only interaction model.
    
    *   A commenter points to **Handy** ([GitHub](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy)) as an existing open-source dictation app with **post-processing capabilities**, suggesting contribution instead of duplicating effort. Another commenter prefers Handy’s UX because it runs as an “invisible” background utility with only a menu bar icon rather than a persistent window.
    *   The project author says the motivation for **Freestyle** is to match paid tools like **Wispr Flow** on both performance and UX, specifically targeting **sub-second transcription latency** plus strong post-processing to clean dictated text while keeping transcription privacy-friendly and subscription-free.
    *   A developer of **DictaFlow** argues that for “local-ish” fast dictation, the key implementation detail is inserting transcription directly into the **currently active text field** across macOS, Windows, and iOS, avoiding clipboard-based insertion, intermediate audio-file workflows, or app switching.

### 1\. AI Public Ownership Proposals

*   **[A proposed bill to give the public a 50% ownership stake in the largest AI companies in America.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1tuf0ka/a_proposed_bill_to_give_the_public_a_50_ownership/)** (Activity: 1729): **Sen. **Bernie Sanders** announced the proposed **American AI Sovereign Wealth Fund Act** in a [YouTube statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN4b4UCWMKI), aiming to give the U.S. public a **`50%` ownership stake in the largest AI companies** and route a share of AI-derived economic value into a sovereign wealth fund. The proposal frames frontier AI firms as potential generators of “trillions” in wealth and targets concentration of ownership/control among major U.S.-based AI companies.** Commenters largely framed the proposal as a pragmatic alternative to banning data centers or resisting AI deployment, with some arguing redistribution mechanisms may be necessary if AI causes large-scale labor displacement. One supportive analogy compared AI to oil, citing Norway’s sovereign wealth approach as a model for capturing national returns from a strategic economic resource.
    
*   **[Bernie Sanders: A.I. Is a Public Resource. You Should Own Half of It.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1tuo0n5/bernie_sanders_ai_is_a_public_resource_you_should/)** (Activity: 887): **The linked **NYT opinion piece by Bernie Sanders** could not be technically summarized because the source returned **`403 Forbidden`** and no article text was available. Based on the title, the post frames **AI as a public resource** and proposes that the public should have partial ownership—_“You Should Own Half of It”_—but no implementation details, policy mechanisms, or technical claims were accessible.** Comments were brief and largely supportive, calling it _“a sane take”_ while raising a resource-infrastructure objection: if AI is public, commenters asked why public ownership does not already apply to **water and power**, especially amid rising utility costs and data-center demand.
    
    *   One commenter argues that Sanders’ stated premise—AI systems were trained on _humanity’s_ accumulated knowledge—does not align with a **U.S.-only sovereign/public ownership mechanism**. They frame the mismatch as: moral claim = global contributors to training data and knowledge; legal vehicle = U.S. taxation or equity claims on U.S. AI firms; beneficiaries = American citizens rather than global creators, researchers, programmers, journalists, and educators.
    *   A detailed critique focuses on implementation mechanics: a forced `50%` public equity stake would only produce public benefit if AI company valuations rise, dividends or proceeds are actually distributed, and governance is handled fairly. The commenter emphasizes that the clearest immediate effect would be **control rights**—voting shares, board seats, and federal influence over frontier AI labs—rather than guaranteed compensation for training-data contributors.
    *   Another commenter supports public ownership in principle as a way to fund universal services or income if AI-driven productivity meaningfully restructures labor markets, but warns that an adversarial approach could suppress innovation. They argue the policy would need to function as a **public-private partnership with AI labs**, not simply as punitive extraction from CEOs or shareholders.

### 2\. Claude and Gemini Reliability Issues

*   **[Rate limit reset](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1ttzjoq/rate_limit_reset/)** (Activity: 1291): **The image is a screenshot of a verified **ClaudeDevs** X post announcing a reset of **5-hour and weekly rate limits** for all **Claude Pro and Max** users after fixing a bug where some **Claude Code** sessions spawned excessive parallel subagents, rapidly consuming quota: [image](https://i.redd.it/hpmsm3l4jp4h1.jpeg). Technically, the issue appears tied to runaway agent/tool-call orchestration, with commenters reporting _“endless tool call loops”_ burning Max-plan session limits and one user joking that the “excessive parallel subagents” were all **Opus 4.8** instances.** Commenters were split between users who hit limits and viewed the reset as generous, and users who did not hit limits but criticized Anthropic for doing resets or operational changes without clearer announcements.
    
    *   A user shared a screenshot indicating the reset may be tied to **“excessive parallel subagents”**, noting that the workload involved multiple **Opus 4.8** instances. This suggests the rate-limit event may have been triggered by high-concurrency agent execution rather than normal single-threaded prompting.
    *   One commenter reported that **tool-call loops** during the weekend consumed their entire session limit on the **Max plan** twice and pushed them above `70%` of their weekly quota, despite that being unusual for their normal usage. This points to runaway agent/tool invocation behavior as a practical failure mode that can rapidly exhaust quota.
    *   Another user said they were at `96%` of their weekly limit, with reset not due until Thursday, and were considering upgrading to the **20x** tier before the account suddenly returned to `0%`. The reset appears to have effectively cleared accumulated weekly usage, potentially mitigating quota exhaustion for users affected by abnormal agent behavior.
*   **[WTF HAPPENING TO GEMINI?!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1tthchq/wtf_happening_to_gemini/)** (Activity: 1203): **The image ([JPEG](https://i.redd.it/2y3sg7glll4h1.jpeg)) shows **Gemini Pro** apparently exposing a Chinese-labeled _“思维过程”_ (“thinking process”) with intermediate calorie/TDEE calculations instead of returning only a normal final answer. In context of the title “WTF HAPPENING TO GEMINI?!!!” and selftext, the post is reporting a likely **Gemini UI/model-output bug** or system-prompt leakage-like behavior, where the model produced code or chain-of-thought-style reasoning unexpectedly after a refresh.** Commenters speculate jokingly that Gemini is “using deepseek api,” while another reports broader instability: irrelevant answers and mixed Thai/Chinese outputs, suggesting users perceive this as a recurring Google/Gemini reliability issue rather than a one-off glitch.
    
    *   Multiple users report **Gemini producing unrelated answers and unexpected multilingual output**, including responses mixing Thai and Chinese despite unrelated prompts. One commenter says this occurred repeatedly “yesterday” and criticized the lack of visible incident/status communication or acknowledgement from Google.
    *   A commenter speculates the issue could stem from a **token decoding / synchronization failure**, where the model’s internal numeric token stream is mapped back into incorrect Unicode/text output, causing random characters or code-like artifacts. This is presented as conjecture rather than confirmed implementation detail.
    *   A comparison is made to **Perplexity**, where a user reports occasional unexplained insertion of isolated Chinese or Russian words and notes that the underlying model is not clearly disclosed, making debugging or attribution difficult.
*   **[Gemini Pro feels much worse than when it first released](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1tuipm1/gemini_pro_feels_much_worse_than_when_it_first/)** (Activity: 1018): **The [image](https://i.redd.it/c0v2d9wbet4h1.png) is a **non-technical Doge meme** illustrating the poster’s claim that **Gemini Pro** has degraded since launch: “Gemini at first release” is shown as strong at coding, memory, logic, context, speed, and image generation, while “Gemini these days” is portrayed as weak, forgetful, and prone to _“ask again later.”_ The post frames this as a paid-tier quality regression versus **ChatGPT Plus** and **Claude**, but provides no benchmarks, model-version comparisons, prompt logs, or reproducible tests—only subjective experience around coding, context handling, and image generation.** Comments are split: some users agree that Gemini’s image generation and even simple writing tasks feel worse and say they switched back to ChatGPT, while others argue this is “rose tinted glasses” and that earlier Gemini versions were actually weaker, with one commenter claiming Gemini only became genuinely good around **Gemini 2.5**.
    
    *   Several commenters report perceived regression in **Gemini Pro** quality, specifically citing weaker _image generation_ and poor performance on simple text tasks like email formatting; one user says they switched back to **ChatGPT** because its image generation produces “creative agency adjacent outputs” from the first prompt.
    *   A technical complaint focuses on **short-context conversational memory**: one user reports Gemini sometimes forgets information from only `5-6` messages earlier in the same chat, suggesting unreliable context retention or instruction tracking within an active session.
    *   One commenter argues the comparison may be affected by model-version history, claiming the first “really good” Gemini release was **Gemini 2.5** in mid-2025 and that earlier Gemini versions were substantially weaker, while another frames nostalgia as “rose tinted glasses” because older AI systems generally underperform current ones.
