**Reflection** raised **$2B** to build frontier open-weight models with a focus on safety and evaluation, led by a team with backgrounds from **AlphaGo**, **PaLM**, and **Gemini**. **Figure** launched its next-gen humanoid robot, **Figure 03**, emphasizing non-teleoperated capabilities for home and large-scale use. **Radical Numerics** released **RND1**, a **30B-parameter sparse MoE diffusion language model** with open weights and code to advance diffusion LM research. **Zhipu** posted strong results with **GLM-4.6** on the Design Arena benchmark, while **AI21 Labs**' **Jamba Reasoning 3B** leads tiny reasoning models. **Anthropic** introduced a plugin system for **Claude Code** to enhance developer tools and agent stacks. The report also highlights SoftBank's acquisition of ABB's robotics unit for **$5.4B** and the growing ecosystem around open frontier modeling and small-model reasoning.
