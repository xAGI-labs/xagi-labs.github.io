**OpenAI** quietly released a new **GPT-4o** model in ChatGPT, distinct from the API version, reclaiming the #1 spot on Lmsys arena benchmarks across multiple categories including math, coding, and instruction-following. Meanwhile, **X.ai** launched **Grok 2**, outperforming **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and previous GPT-4o versions, with plans for enterprise API release. Grok 2 integrates **Black Forest Labs' Flux.1**, an open-source text-to-image model surpassing **Stable Diffusion 3**. **Google DeepMind** announced **Gemini Advanced** with enhanced conversational features and Pixel device integration. AI researcher **ylecun** highlighted LLM limitations in learning and creativity, while **rohanpaul\_ai** discussed an AI Scientist system generating publishable ML research at low cost. **karpathy** warned of security risks in LLM tokenizers akin to SQL injection.
