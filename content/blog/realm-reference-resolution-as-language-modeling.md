**Apple** is advancing in AI with a new approach called **ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling**, which improves understanding of ambiguous references using three contexts and finetunes a smaller **FLAN-T5** model that outperforms **GPT-4** on this task. In Reddit AI news, an open-source coding agent **SWE-agent** achieves **12.29%** on the SWE-bench benchmark, and **RAGFlow** introduces a customizable retrieval-augmented generation engine. A new quantization method, **QuaRot**, enables efficient 4-bit inference. AI applications include a t-shirt design generator, **podgenai** for GPT-4 based podcast generation, and an open-source model from **HuggingFace** that runs without a GPU. Industry discussions focus on the impact of large language models on the AI field and efforts to decentralize AI development. **Takuto Takizawa** joins **Stability AI Japan** as Head of Sales & Partnerships.
