**Romain Huet** demonstrated an unreleased version of **GPT-4o** on ChatGPT Desktop showcasing capabilities like low latency voice generation, whisper tone moderation, camera mode streaming video to GPT-4o, rapid OCR, screen sharing with ChatGPT for programming help, clipboard reading, and vision-based code conversation. OpenAI's four investment areas highlighted include textual intelligence, efficiency/cost, model customization, and multimodal agents. **Google DeepMind** released **Gemma 2** models in 9B and 27B sizes trained on 8T and 13T tokens respectively, using SFT, distillation, RLHF, and model merging, optimized for TPUv5e with strong performance and safety measures. **Meta AI** announced the Meta LLM Compiler built on Meta Code Llama with enhanced code optimization and compiler features.
