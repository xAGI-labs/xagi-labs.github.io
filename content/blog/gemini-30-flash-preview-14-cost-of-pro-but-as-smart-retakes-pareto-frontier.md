**Google** launched **Gemini 3 Flash**, a pro-grade reasoning model with flash latency, supporting tool calling and multimodal IO, available via multiple platforms including Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. It offers competitive pricing at $0.50 per 1M input tokens and $3.00 per 1M output tokens, with context windows up to 1M tokens. Benchmarks show **Gemini 3 Flash** rivals or outperforms larger models like **GPT-5.2** and **Gemini 3 Pro** in agentic, coding, and reasoning tasks, validated by ARC-AGI-2, SWE-bench, LMArena, and Arena benchmarks. Despite some tradeoffs like high token use and hallucination rates, it is cost-effective overall. Key figures include **Sundar Pichai**, **Jeff Dean**, and **Demis Hassabis** who publicly celebrated this achievement. The model's tool calling capabilities were demonstrated with 100 tools in a live demo.
