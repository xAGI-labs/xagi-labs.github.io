**OpenAI** announced support for **MCP**, a significant technical update. **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro** leads benchmarks with top scores in **MMLU-Pro (86%)**, **GPQA Diamond (83%)**, and **AIME 2024 (88%)**, featuring a **1 million token context window** and multimodal inputs. **Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 Omni 7B** was released as a fully multimodal, interactive, open-source model with a novel "thinker-talker" architecture supporting voice and video chat. **DeepSeek V3-0324** outperforms its predecessor on multiple benchmarks. Research on reasoning features in large language models using sparse autoencoders was highlighted, alongside a study on scaling laws of synthetic data showing performance plateaus near **300B tokens**. Discussions also covered the fastest output speeds of Gemini models and concerns about over-reliance on benchmarks for intelligence measurement. \*Swyx\* will curate the Data Council AI Engineering Track in April.
