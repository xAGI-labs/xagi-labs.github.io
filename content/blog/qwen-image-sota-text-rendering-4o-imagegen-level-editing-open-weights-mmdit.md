**Alibaba** surprised with the release of **Qwen-Image**, a **20B MMDiT** model excelling at bilingual text rendering and graphic poster creation, with open weights and demos available. **Google DeepMind** launched **Gemini 2.5 Deep Think** to Ultra subscribers, showing significant reasoning improvements and benchmark gains (+11.2% AIME, +13.2% HLE, +13.4% LiveCodeBench) rivaling **OpenAI's o3 Pro**. ByteDance's **SeedProver** achieved state-of-the-art math theorem proving results, surpassing DeepMind's AlphaGeometry2. OpenAI is developing a "universal verifier" for math and coding gains transfer. Competitive reasoning benchmarks and game arenas by Google and Kaggle highlight a meta-shift in reasoning model efficiency, comparable to the original Transformer leap. Other open-weight models gaining momentum include **GLM-4.5**, **XBai o4**, and **Tencent Hunyuan** with a focus on efficient training. \*"Qwen is all you need."\*
