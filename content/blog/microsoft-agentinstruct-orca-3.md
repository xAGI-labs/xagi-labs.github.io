**Microsoft Research** released **AgentInstruct**, the third paper in its **Orca** series, introducing a generative teaching pipeline that produces **25.8 million** synthetic instructions to fine-tune **mistral-7b**, achieving significant performance gains: +40% AGIEval, +19% MMLU, +54% GSM8K, +38% BBH, +45% AlpacaEval, and a 31.34% reduction in hallucinations. This synthetic data approach follows the success of **FineWeb** and **Apple's Rephrasing research** in improving dataset quality. Additionally, **Tencent** claims to have generated **1 billion** diverse personas for synthetic data. On AI Twitter, notable discussions included a shooting incident at a Trump rally and recent ML research highlights such as **FlashAttention-3**, **RankRAG**, and **Mixture of A Million Experts**.
