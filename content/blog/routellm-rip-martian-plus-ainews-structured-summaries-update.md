**LMSys** introduces RouteLLM, an open-source router framework trained on **preference data** from Chatbot Arena, achieving **cost reductions over 85% on MT Bench, 45% on MMLU, and 35% on GSM8K** while maintaining **95% of GPT-4's performance**. This approach surpasses previous task-specific routing by using syntax-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing and data augmentation, beating commercial solutions by 40%. The update highlights advances in **LLM routing**, **cost-efficiency**, and **model performance optimization** across multiple models rather than single-model or MoE-level improvements. Additionally, the AI Twitter recap notes the **Gemma 2 model family** as a top open model, the **Block Transformer architecture** for improved inference throughput, and a proposal for a fully Software 2.0 computer vision system by **karpathy**.
