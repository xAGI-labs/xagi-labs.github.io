**OpenAI's o1-preview** model has achieved a milestone by fully matching top daily AI news stories without human intervention, consistently outperforming other models like **Anthropic**, **Google**, and **Llama 3** in vibe check evaluations. **OpenAI** models dominate the top 4 slots on **LMsys** benchmarks, with rate limits increasing to **500-1000 requests per minute**. In open source, **Alibaba's Qwen 2.5** suite surpasses **Llama 3.1** at the 70B scale and updates its closed **Qwen-Plus** models to outperform **DeepSeek V2.5** but still lag behind leading American models. **Kyutai Moshi** released its open weights realtime voice model featuring a unique streaming neural architecture with an "inner monologue." **Weights & Biases** introduced **Weave**, an LLM observability toolkit that enhances experiment tracking and evaluation, turning prompting into a more scientific process. The news also highlights upcoming events like the **WandB LLM-as-judge hackathon** in San Francisco. \*"o1-preview consistently beats out our vibe check evals"\* and \*"OpenAI models are gradually raising rate limits by the day."\*
