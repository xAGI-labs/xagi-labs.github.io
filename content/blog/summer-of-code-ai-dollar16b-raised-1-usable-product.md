**Code + AI** is emphasized as a key modality in AI engineering, highlighting productivity and verifiability benefits. Recent major funding rounds include **Cognition AI raising $175M**, **Poolside raising $400M**, **Codeium AI raising $150M**, and **Magic raising $320M**. Magic announced their **LTM-2** model with a **100 million token context window**, boasting efficiency improvements over **Llama 3.1 405B** by about **1000x cheaper** in sequence-dimension algorithm and drastically lower memory requirements. Magic's stack is built from scratch with custom CUDA and no open-source foundations, partnered with **Google Cloud** and powered by **NVIDIA H100** and **GB200 GPUs**, aiming to scale to tens of thousands of GPUs. Google DeepMind revealed updates to **Gemini Advanced** with customizable expert "Gems." Neural Game Engines like **GameNGen** can run DOOM in a diffusion model trained on **0.9B frames**. The content also references **LLM quantization** research by Rohan Paul.
