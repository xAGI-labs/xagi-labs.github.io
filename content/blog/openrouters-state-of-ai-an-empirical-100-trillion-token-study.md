**OpenRouter** released its first survey showing usage trends with 7 trillion tokens proxied weekly, highlighting a 52% roleplay bias. **Deepseek**'s open model market share has sharply declined due to rising coding model usage. Reasoning model token usage surged from 0% to over 50%. **Grok Code Fast** shows high usage, while **Anthropic** leads in tool calling and coding requests with around 60% share. Input tokens quadrupled and output tokens tripled this year, driven mainly by programming use cases, which dominate spending and volume. Google launched **Gemini 3 Deep Think**, featuring parallel thinking and achieving 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 benchmarks, and previewed **Titans**, a long-context neural memory architecture scaling beyond 2 million tokens. These advances were shared by **Google DeepMind** and **Google AI** on Twitter.
