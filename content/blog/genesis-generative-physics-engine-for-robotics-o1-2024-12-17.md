**Genesis** is a newly announced **universal physics engine** developed by a large-scale collaboration led by **CMU PhD student Zhou Xian**. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art physics solvers to simulate diverse materials and physical phenomena, targeting robotics applications with features like lightweight, ultra-fast simulation, photo-realistic rendering, and generative data capabilities. The engine is open source and designed for robotics simulation beyond just video generation. Additionally, **OpenAI** released the **o1** model to API with advanced features like function calling and vision support, showing strong math and coding performance. **Google** teased updates on **Gemini 2.0 Pro**, accelerating deployment for advanced users.
