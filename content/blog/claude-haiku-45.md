**Anthropic** released **Claude Haiku 4.5**, a model that is over 2x faster and 3x cheaper than **Claude Sonnet 4.5**, improving iteration speed and user experience significantly. Pricing comparisons highlight Haiku 4.5's competitive cost against models like **GPT-5** and **GLM-4.6**. **Google** and **Yale** introduced the open-weight **Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (Gemma)** model, which generated a novel, experimentally validated cancer hypothesis, with open-sourced weights for community use. Early evaluations show **GPT-5** and **o3** models outperform **GPT-4.1** in agentic reasoning tasks, balancing cost and performance. Agent evaluation challenges and memory-based learning advances were also discussed, with contributions from Shanghai AI Lab and others. \*"Haiku 4.5 materially improves iteration speed and UX,"\* and \*"Cell2Sentence-Scale yielded validated cancer hypothesis"\* were key highlights.
