**DeepSeek Janus** and **Meta SpiRit-LM** are two notable multimodality AI models recently released, showcasing advances in image generation and speech synthesis respectively. DeepSeek Janus separates vision encoders for image understanding and generation, achieving better results in both tasks. Meta's SpiRit-LM introduces an expressive speech and writing model generating pitch and style units, improving over standard TTS. Additionally, **W&B Weave** offers comprehensive LLM observability and multimodality fine-tuning tools. Industry updates include Nvidia's Nemotron 70b model underperforming, Meta open-sourcing Movie Gen Bench for media generation benchmarking, Perplexity launching internal search with multi-step reasoning, and Anthropic updating Claude apps. Open source progress includes Hugging Face's gradient accumulation fix in transformers and advocacy for open source AI to prevent Big Tech dominance. \*"Model merging for combining skills of multiple models"\* is also highlighted.
