Rumors about a **GPT-4.5** release circulated without official confirmation. Concerns were raised about "selective censorship" affecting language model performance. The EU's potential regulation of AI, including **ChatGPT**, was highlighted. Users reported issues with **ChatGPT Plus** message limits and subscription upgrades, and shared experiences with **BingChat** and **DALL-E**. The community discussed prompt engineering techniques and future applications like image generation and MIDI sequence analysis, expressing hopes for **GPT-5**.
