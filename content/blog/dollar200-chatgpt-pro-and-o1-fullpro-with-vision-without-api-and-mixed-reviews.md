**OpenAI** launched the **o1** model with multimodal capabilities, faster reasoning, and image input support, marking it as a state-of-the-art model despite some bugs and mixed community reviews. The new **o1-pro** tier offers unlimited access for $200/month with notable benchmark improvements but some performance trade-offs compared to **claude-3.5-sonnet**. **Google** released the **PaliGemma 2** vision-language model family in sizes **3B, 10B, and 28B**, excelling in visual question answering, image segmentation, and OCR, with day-0 support for fine-tuning. **LlamaIndex** announced discounts and feature updates for large-scale document processing. The AI community also reacted humorously to the new pricing tiers and model comparisons. \*"o1 can see now, which makes it the SOTA multimodal model"\* and \*"most users will be best served by free/Plus tiers"\* were notable sentiments.
