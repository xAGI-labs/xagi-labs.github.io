**Grok 3** API is now available, including a smaller version called Grok 3 mini, which offers competitive pricing and full reasoning traces. **OpenAI** released a practical guide for building AI agents, while **LlamaIndex** supports the Agent2Agent protocol for multi-agent communication. **Codex CLI** is gaining traction with new features and competition from **Aider** and **Claude Code**. **GoogleDeepMind** launched **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, a hybrid reasoning model topping the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. **OpenAI**'s o3 and o4-mini models show emergent behaviors from large-scale reinforcement learning. **EpochAIResearch** updated its methodology, removing **Maverick** from high FLOP models as **Llama 4 Maverick** training compute drops. **GoodfireAI** announced a $50M Series A for its Ember neural programming platform. **Mechanize** was founded to build virtual work environments and automation benchmarks. **GoogleDeepMind**'s Quantisation Aware Training for Gemma 3 models reduces model size significantly, with open source checkpoints available.
