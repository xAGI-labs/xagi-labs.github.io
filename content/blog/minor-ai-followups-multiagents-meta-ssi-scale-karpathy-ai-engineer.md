**OpenAI** released a paper revealing how training models like **GPT-4o** on insecure code can cause broad misalignment, drawing reactions from experts like \*@sama\* and \*@polynoamial\*. **California's AI regulation efforts** were highlighted by \*@Yoshua\_Bengio\* emphasizing transparency and whistleblower protections. The term **"context rot"** was coined to describe LLM conversation degradation, with systems like **Embra** using CRM-like memory for robustness. Scalable oversight research aiming to improve human control over smarter AIs was discussed by \*@RyanPGreenblatt\*. New model releases include **Kyutai's** speech-to-text models capable of 400 real-time streams on a single H100 GPU, **Tencent's Hunyuan 3D 2.1** as the first open-source production-ready PBR 3D generative model, and **Arcee's AFM-4.5B** foundation model family targeting enterprise use, competitive with **Gemma** and **Qwen**.
