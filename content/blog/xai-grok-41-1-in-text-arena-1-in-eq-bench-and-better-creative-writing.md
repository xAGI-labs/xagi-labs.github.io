\*\*xAI\*\* launched \*\*Grok 4.1\*\*, achieving a #1 rank on the LM Arena Text Leaderboard with an Elo score of \*\*1483\*\*, showing improvements in creative writing and anti-hallucination. \*\*OpenAI's GPT-5.1 "Thinking"\*\* demonstrates efficiency gains with ~60% less "thinking" on easy queries and strong ARC-AGI performance. \*\*Google DeepMind\*\* released \*\*WeatherNext 2\*\*, an ensemble generative model that is \*\*8× faster\*\* and more accurate for global weather forecasts, integrated into multiple Google products. \*\*Sakana AI\*\* raised \*\*¥20B ($135M)\*\* in Series B funding at a \*\*$2.63B\*\* valuation to focus on efficient AI for resource-constrained enterprise applications in Japan. New evaluations highlight tradeoffs between hallucination and knowledge accuracy across models including \*\*Claude 4.1 Opus\*\* and \*\*Anthropic\*\* models.
