**Manus** achieved a rapid growth trajectory in 2025, raising **$500M** from Benchmark and reaching **$100M ARR** before being acquired by **Meta** for an estimated **$4B**. The **vLLM** team launched a dedicated community site with new resources, while performance issues with **AMD MI300X FP8** were noted in **vLLM** and **sglang** benchmarks. **Weaviate** released operational features including **Object TTL**, **Java v6 client GA**, and **multimodal document embeddings**. API fragmentation concerns were raised by **Teknium** advocating for unified SDK wrappers. In open-weight models, **GLM-4.7** gained recognition as a reliable coding model with faster throughput on **Baseten**, and **MiniMax-M2.1** rose as a leading open agentic coder model, topping WebDev leaderboards.
