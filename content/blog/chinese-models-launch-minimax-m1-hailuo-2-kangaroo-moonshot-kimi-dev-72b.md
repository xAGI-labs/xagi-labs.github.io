**MiniMax AI** launched **MiniMax-M1**, a 456 billion parameter open weights LLM with a 1 million token input and 80k token output using efficient "lightning attention" and a GRPO variant called CISPO. **MiniMax AI** also announced **Hailuo 02 (0616)**, a video model similar to **ByteDance's Seedance**. **Moonshot AI** released **Kimi-Dev-72B**, a coding model outperforming **DeepSeek R1** on SWEBench Verified. Discussions on multi-agent system design from **Anthropic** and **LangChain** highlighted improvements in task completion and challenges like prompt injection attacks, as demonstrated by **Karpathy** and **Columbia University** research. **Sakana AI** introduced **ALE-Agent**, a coding agent that ranked 21st in the AtCoder Heuristic Competition solving NP-hard optimization problems. There is unverified news about an acquisition involving **OpenAI**, **Microsoft**, and **Windsurf**.
