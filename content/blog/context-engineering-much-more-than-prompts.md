**Context Engineering** emerges as a significant trend in AI, highlighted by experts like **Andrej Karpathy**, **Walden Yan** from **Cognition**, and **Tobi Lutke**. It involves managing an LLM's context window with the right mix of prompts, retrieval, tools, and state to optimize performance, going beyond traditional prompt engineering. **LangChain** and its tool **LangGraph** are noted for advancing this approach. Additionally, **OpenAI** has launched **ChatGPT connectors** for platforms like **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, **SharePoint**, and **Box**, enhancing context integration for Pro users. Other notable news includes the launch of **Vercel Sandbox**, **Cloudflare Containers**, the leak and release of **Gemini Code** by **Google DeepMind**, and fundraising efforts by **OpenRouter**.
