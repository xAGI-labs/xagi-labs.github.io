**OpenAI** launched **Operator**, a premium computer-using agent for web tasks like booking and ordering, available now for Pro users in the US with an API promised. It features long horizon remote VMs up to 20 minutes and video export, showing state-of-the-art agent performance but not yet human-level. **Anthropic** had launched a similar agent 3 months earlier as an open source demo. **DeepSeek AI** unveiled **DeepSeek R1**, an open-source reasoning model excelling on the **Humanity's Last Exam** dataset, outperforming models like **LLaMA 4** and **OpenAI's o1**. **Google DeepMind** open-sourced **VideoLLaMA 3**, a multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. **Perplexity AI** released **Perplexity Assistant** for Android with reasoning and search capabilities. The **Humanity's Last Exam** dataset contains 3,000 questions testing AI reasoning, with current models scoring below 10% accuracy, indicating room for improvement. OpenAI's Computer-Using Agent (CUA) shows improved performance on OSWorld and WebArena benchmarks but still lags behind humans. **Anthropic AI** introduced Citations for safer AI responses. \*Sam Altman\* and \*Swyx\* commented on Operator's launch and capabilities.
