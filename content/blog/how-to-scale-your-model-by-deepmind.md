**Researchers at Google DeepMind (GDM)** released a comprehensive "little textbook" titled **"How To Scale Your Model"** covering modern Transformer architectures, inference optimizations beyond O(N^2) attention, and high-performance computing concepts like rooflines. The resource includes practical problems and real-time comment engagement. On AI Twitter, several key updates include the open-sourced humanoid robotics model **ASAP** inspired by athletes like **Cristiano Ronaldo**, **LeBron James**, and **Kobe Bryant**; a new paper on **Mixture-of-Agents** proposing the **Self-MoA** method for improved LLM output aggregation; training of reasoning LLMs using the **GRPO algorithm** from **DeepSeek** demonstrated on **Qwen 0.5**; findings on bias in LLMs used as judges highlighting the need for multiple independent evaluations; and the release of **mlx-rs**, a Rust library for machine learning with examples including **Mistral** text generation. Additionally, **Hugging Face** launched an AI app store featuring over **400,000 apps** with 2,000 new daily additions and 2.5 million weekly visits, enabling AI-powered app search and categorization.
