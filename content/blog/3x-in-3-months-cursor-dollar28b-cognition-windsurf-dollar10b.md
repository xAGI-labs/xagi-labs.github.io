**Cursor** is reportedly fundraising at a **$28 billion valuation with $1 billion ARR**, while the combined **Cognition+Windsurf** entity is fundraising at a **$10 billion valuation** after acquiring Windsurf remainco for $300 million. The competition between AI coding agents intensifies as Cursor focuses on Async SWE Agents and Cognition+Windsurf acquires an agentic IDE. **Alibaba's Qwen3-Coder** gains widespread adoption for coding tasks and integration into tools like **Claude Code** and **LM Studio**. **OpenAI** rolls out **ChatGPT Agent** to all Plus, Pro, and Team users, sparking discussions about an "agentic economy" emphasizing **AI literacy**. **Anthropic's Claude Code** is praised as a premier development tool with active community feedback. **Perplexity's Comet browser assistant** receives positive reviews and new feature showcases. The debate continues on whether AI coding tools will replace developers, with critiques highlighting the ongoing human effort required. A new minimalistic software engineering agent, **mini**, achieves 65% on SWE-bench with just 100 lines of code.
