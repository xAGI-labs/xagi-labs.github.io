**OpenAI** released **GPT-5.1** family models including **5.1-Codex** and **5.1-Codex-Mini** with improved steerability, faster responses, and new tools like apply\_patch and shell command execution. Pricing remains unchanged from 5.0. Immediate integrations include **GitHub Copilot**, **VS Code**, **Cursor**, and **Perplexity** adopting GPT-5.1 models. **Google DeepMind** announced **SIMA 2**, a **Gemini**-powered agent capable of language instruction following, planning, and self-improvement without human feedback, targeting robotics applications. New research on context engineering and agentic tool use patterns was published, with contributions from **Weaviate** and **LlamaIndex** on database query planning and chart parsing respectively. \*"Adaptive reasoning"\* and agentic coding improvements are highlighted in GPT-5.1- Instant.
