**Google's Veo 2** video generation model is now available in the **Gemini API** with a cost of **35 cents per second** of generated video, marking a significant step in accessible video generation. Meanwhile, China's **Kling 2** model launched with pricing around **$2 for a 10-second clip** and a minimum subscription of **$700 per month for 3 months**, generating excitement despite some skill challenges. **OpenAI** announced the **GPT-4.1 family** release, including **GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano**, highlighting improvements in **coding, instruction following, and a 1 million token context window**. The GPT-4.1 models are **26% cheaper than GPT-4o** and will replace the **GPT-4.5 Preview** API version by July 14. Performance benchmarks show GPT-4.1 achieving **54-55% on SWE-bench verified** and a **60% improvement over GPT-4o** in some internal tests, though some critiques note it underperforms compared to other models like OpenRouter and DeepSeekV3 in coding tasks. The release is API-only, with a prompting guide provided for developers.
