**Safe Superintelligence** raised **$1 billion** at a **$5 billion** valuation, focusing on safety and search approaches as hinted by Ilya Sutskever. **Sakana AI** secured a **$100 million Series A** funding round, emphasizing nature-inspired collective intelligence. **You.com** pivoted to a ChatGPT-like productivity agent after a **$50 million Series B** round, while **Perplexity AI** raised over **$250 million** this summer. **Anthropic** launched Claude for Enterprise with a **500 million token context window**. **AI2** released a **64-expert Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model** called OLMo, outperforming Llama2-13B-Chat. Key AI research trends include efficient MoE architectures, challenges in AI alignment and GPU costs, and emerging AI agents for autonomous tasks. Innovations in AI development feature command and control for video generation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) efficiency, and GitHub integration under Anthropic's Enterprise plan. \*"Our logo is meant to invoke the idea of a school of fish coming together and forming a coherent entity from simple rules as we want to make use of ideas from nature such as evolution and collective intelligence in our research."\*
