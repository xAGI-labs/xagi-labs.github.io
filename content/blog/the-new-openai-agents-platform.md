**OpenAI** introduced a comprehensive suite of new tools for AI agents, including the **Responses API**, **Web Search Tool**, **Computer Use Tool**, **File Search Tool**, and an open-source **Agents SDK** with integrated observability tools, marking a significant step towards the "Year of Agents." Meanwhile, **Reka AI** open-sourced **Reka Flash 3**, a **21B parameter reasoning model** that outperforms **o1-mini** and powers their Nexus platform, with weights available on **Hugging Face**. The **OlympicCoder** series surpassed **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** and much larger models on competitive coding benchmarks. **DeepSeek** built a **32K GPU cluster** capable of training V3-level models in under a week and is exploring AI distillation. **Hugging Face** announced **Cerebras** inference support, achieving over **2,000 tokens/s** on **Llama 3.3 70B**, 70x faster than leading GPUs. **Reka's Sonic-2** voice AI model delivers **40ms latency** via the **Together API**. **Alibaba's Qwen Chat** enhanced its multimodal interface with video understanding up to **500MB**, voice-to-text, guest mode, and expanded file uploads. \*Sama\* praised OpenAI's new API as "one of the most well-designed and useful APIs ever."
