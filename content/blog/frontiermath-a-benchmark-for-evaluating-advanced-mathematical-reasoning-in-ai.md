**Epoch AI** collaborated with over **60 leading mathematicians** to create the **FrontierMath benchmark**, a fresh set of hundreds of original math problems with easy-to-verify answers, aiming to challenge current AI models. The benchmark reveals that all tested models, including **o1**, perform poorly, highlighting the difficulty of complex problem-solving and **Moravec's paradox** in AI. Key AI developments include the introduction of **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)**, a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture reducing computational costs, and improvements in **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** through incorrect reasoning and explanations. Industry news covers **OpenAI** acquiring the **chat.com** domain, **Microsoft** launching the **Magentic-One agent framework**, **Anthropic** releasing **Claude 3.5 Haiku** outperforming **gpt-4o** on some benchmarks, and **xAI** securing **150MW grid power** with support from **Elon Musk** and **Trump**. **LangChain AI** introduced new tools including a **Financial Metrics API**, **Document GPT** with PDF upload and Q&A, and **LangPost** AI agent for LinkedIn posts. **xAI** also demonstrated the **Grok Engineer** compatible with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs for code generation.
