**Over 2500 new community members joined following Soumith Chintala's shoutout, highlighting growing interest in SOTA LLM-based summarization. The major highlight is the detailed paper release of **Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3)**, showcasing advanced text-in-image control and complex prompt handling, with the model outperforming other SOTA image generation models in human-evaluated benchmarks. The SD3 model is based on an enhanced Diffusion Transformer architecture called **MMDiT**. Meanwhile, **Anthropic** released **Claude 3** models, noted for human-like responses and emotional depth, scoring 79.88% on HumanEval but costing over twice as much as GPT-4. Microsoft launched new Orca-based models and datasets, and Latitude released **DolphinCoder-StarCoder2-15b** with strong coding capabilities. Integration of image models by **Perplexity AI** and 3D CAD generation by **PolySpectra** powered by **LlamaIndex** were also highlighted. \*"SD3's win rate beats all other SOTA image gen models (except perhaps Ideogram)"\* and \*"Claude 3 models are very good at generating d3 visualizations from text descriptions."\*
