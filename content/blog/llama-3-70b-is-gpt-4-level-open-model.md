**Meta** has released **Llama 3**, their most capable open large language model with **8B and 70B parameter versions** supporting **8K context length** and outperforming previous models including **Llama 2** and **Mistral 7B**. **Groq** serves the **Llama 3 70B** model at **500-800 tokens/second**, making it the fastest GPT-4-level token source. Discussions highlight AI scaling challenges with **Elon Musk** stating that training **Grok 3** will require **100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs**, and **AWS** planning to acquire **20,000 B200 GPUs** for a **27 trillion parameter model**. Microsoft unveiled **VASA-1** for lifelike talking face generation, while **Stable Diffusion 3** and its extensions received mixed impressions. Concerns about AI energy usage and political bias in AI were also discussed.
