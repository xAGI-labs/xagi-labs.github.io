**Deepmind's AlphaEvolve**, a 2025 update to AlphaTensor and FunSearch, is a Gemini-powered **coding agent for algorithm discovery** that designs faster matrix multiplication algorithms, solves open math problems, and improves data center and AI training efficiency. It achieves a **23% faster kernel speedup** in Gemini training and surpasses state-of-the-art on 20% of applied problems, including improvements on the Minimum Overlap Problem and Kissing number problem. Unlike Deep-RL, it optimizes code pieces rather than model weights. Meanwhile, **OpenAI** released **GPT-4.1** in ChatGPT, specializing in coding and instruction following, with a faster alternative **GPT-4.1 mini** replacing GPT-4o mini for all users. OpenAI also launched the Safety Evaluations Hub and the OpenAI to Z Challenge using o3/o4 mini and GPT-4.1 models to discover archaeological sites. \*"Maybe midtrain + good search is all you need for AI for scientific innovation"\* - Jason Wei.
