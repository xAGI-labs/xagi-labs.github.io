**UC Berkeley's EPIC lab** introduces innovative LLM data operators with projects like **LOTUS** and **DocETL**, focusing on effective programming and computation over large data corpora. This approach contrasts GPU-rich big labs like **Deepmind** and **OpenAI** with GPU-poor compound AI systems. **Microsoft** open-sourced **BitNet b1.58**, a 1-bit ternary parameter LLM enabling **4-20x faster training** and on-device inference at human reading speeds. Nvidia released **Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct**, a fine-tuned open-source model outperforming **GPT-4o** and **Claude-3.5-sonnet**. These developments highlight advances in **model-optimization**, **on-device-ai**, and **fine-tuning**.
