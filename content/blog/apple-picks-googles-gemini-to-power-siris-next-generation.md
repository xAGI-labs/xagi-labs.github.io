**Apple** has decided to power Siri with **Google's Gemini models** and cloud technology, marking a significant partnership and a setback for **OpenAI**, which was initially partnered with Apple. **Anthropic** launched "Cowork," a product preview for Claude's coding capabilities, sparking discussions about "LLM OS". **OpenAI** introduced **ChatGPT Health** and acquired **Torch** to expand in healthcare AI. **DeepSeek** unveiled **Engram**, a new conditional memory module that enables O(1) lookup-style memory for static patterns, improving long-context handling and offering hardware-friendly optimizations to scale knowledge capacity efficiently.
