**OpenAI** launched the **o3** and **o4-mini** models, emphasizing improvements in **reinforcement-learning scaling** and overall efficiency, making **o4-mini** cheaper and better across prioritized metrics. These models showcase enhanced **vision** and **tool use** capabilities, though API access for these features is pending. The release includes **Codex CLI**, an open-source coding agent that integrates with these models to convert natural language into working code. Accessibility extends to **ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users**, with **o3** being notably more expensive than **Gemini 2.5 Pro**. Performance benchmarks highlight the intelligence gains from scaling inference, with comparisons against models like **Sonnet** and **Gemini**. The launch has been well received despite some less favorable evaluation results.
