**MMLU-Pro** is gaining attention as the successor to MMLU on the **Open LLM Leaderboard V2** by **HuggingFace**, despite community concerns about evaluation discrepancies and prompt sensitivity affecting model performance, notably a **10-point improvement** in **Llama-3-8b-q8** with simple prompt tweaks. **Meta's MobileLLM** research explores running sub-billion parameter LLMs on smartphones using shared weights and deeper architectures. **Salesforce's APIGen** introduces an automated dataset generation system for function-calling tasks outperforming larger models. **Runway Gen-3 Alpha** launches an AI video generator for paid users creating realistic 10-second clips. **Nomic AI's GPT4All 3.0** offers an open-source desktop app supporting thousands of local models. AI assistants with multimodal capabilities and affordable access to multiple LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, and Gemini are emerging. **Meta 3D Gen** advances text-to-3D asset generation, while Argil AI enables deepfake video creation from text threads. Research on transformer grokking and reasoning highlights advances in robust reasoning capabilities.
