**Together AI and Agentica** released **DeepCoder-14B**, an open-source 14B parameter coding model rivaling OpenAI's **o3-mini** and **o1** on coding benchmarks, trained with an open-source RL framework from ByteDance and costing about **$26,880**. **Google DeepMind** launched **Gemini 2.5 Pro** with experimental "Flash" versions available to subscribers. **Moonshot AI** introduced **Kimi-VL-A3B**, a multimodal model with **128K context** outperforming **gpt-4o** on vision and math benchmarks. **Meta AI** released **Llama 4 Scout** and **Maverick**, with a larger **Behemoth** model in training, featuring mixture-of-experts and L2 norm techniques. **Runway** launched **Gen-4 Turbo** with 10x better results than Gen-3 at the same cost. **Google** announced **Imagen 3**, a high-quality text-to-image model now in Vertex AI, enabling easier object removal. The report highlights open-source contributions, reinforcement learning training optimizations, and significant model performance improvements across coding, multimodal, and image generation domains.
