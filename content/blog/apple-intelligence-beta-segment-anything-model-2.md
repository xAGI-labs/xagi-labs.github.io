**Meta** advanced its open source AI with a sequel to the **Segment Anything Model**, enhancing image segmentation with memory attention for video applications using minimal data and compute. **Apple Intelligence** delayed its official release to iOS 18.1 in October but launched developer previews on **MacOS Sequoia**, **iOS 18**, and **iPadOS 18**, accompanied by a detailed 47-page paper revealing extensive pretraining on **6.3T tokens** and use of **Cloud TPUs** rather than Apple Silicon. The paper highlights improvements in instruction following, reasoning, and writing through post-training and synthetic data. Benchmarks show Apple’s model scores lower than **Llama 3**, but with trusted human evaluations. Additionally, **Meta** released **Llama 3.1** with a 405B parameter model, marking a significant open-source frontier model release.
