**Google** launched **Gemini Live** on Android for **Gemini Advanced** subscribers during the Pixel 9 event, featuring integrations with Google Workspace apps and other Google services. The rollout began on 8/12/2024, with iOS support planned. **Anthropic** released **Genie**, an AI software engineering system achieving a **57%** improvement on SWE-Bench. **TII** introduced **Falcon Mamba**, a 7B attention-free open-access model scalable to long sequences. Benchmarking showed that longer context lengths do not always improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation. **Supabase** launched an AI-powered Postgres service dubbed the "ChatGPT of databases," fully open source. **Perplexity AI** partnered with Polymarket to integrate real-time probability predictions into search results. A tutorial demonstrated a multimodal recipe recommender using **Qdrant**, **LlamaIndex**, and **Gemini**. An OpenAI engineer shared success tips emphasizing debugging and hard work. The connection between matrices and graphs in linear algebra was highlighted for insights into nonnegative matrices and strongly connected components. **Keras 3.5.0** was released with Hugging Face Hub integration for model saving and loading.
