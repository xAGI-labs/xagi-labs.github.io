\*\*Grok 3\*\* has launched with mixed opinions but strong benchmark performance, notably outperforming models like \*\*Gemini 2 Pro\*\* and \*\*GPT-4o\*\*. The \*\*Grok-3 mini\*\* variant shows competitive and sometimes superior capabilities, especially in reasoning and coding, with reinforcement learning playing a key role. \*\*Mira Murati\*\* has publicly shared her post-OpenAI plan, founding the frontier lab \*\*Thinking Machines\*\*, focusing on collaborative, personalizable AI, multimodality, and empirical safety and alignment research, reminiscent of \*\*Anthropic\*\*'s approach.
