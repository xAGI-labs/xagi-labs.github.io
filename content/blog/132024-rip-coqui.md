**Coqui**, a prominent open source text-to-speech project from the Mozilla ML group, officially shut down. Discussions in the **HuggingFace** Discord highlighted skepticism about the claimed \`3X faster\` speed of **sdxl**, attributing improvements more to techniques like \`torch.compile\` and removal of \`fp16\` and \`attention\` rather than **diffusers 0.25** features. Users confirmed that a \*HuggingFace user token\* can be used across multiple machines, though distinct tokens are recommended for safety. The **Learning Loss Minimization (LLM) Leaderboard** briefly experienced issues but was later confirmed operational. A Kaggle notebook was shared demonstrating how to build Transformer architectures from scratch using PyTorch. Additionally, a new image dataset with 15k shoe, sandal, and boot images was introduced for multiclass classification tasks. Explanations about the workings of the Common Crawl web-crawling process were also shared.
