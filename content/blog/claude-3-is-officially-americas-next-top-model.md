**Claude 3 Opus** outperforms **GPT4T** and **Mistral Large** in blind Elo rankings, with **Claude 3 Haiku** marking a new cost-performance frontier. Fine-tuning techniques like **QLoRA** on **Mistral 7B** and evolutionary model merging on HuggingFace models are highlighted. Public opinion shows strong opposition to ASI development. Research supervision opportunities in AI alignment are announced. The **Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3)** release raises workflow concerns for tools like **ComfyUI** and **automatic1111**. **Opus** shows a 5% performance dip on **OpenRouter** compared to the **Anthropic API**. A new benchmark stresses LLM recall at long contexts, with **Mistral 7B** struggling and **Qwen 72b** performing well.
