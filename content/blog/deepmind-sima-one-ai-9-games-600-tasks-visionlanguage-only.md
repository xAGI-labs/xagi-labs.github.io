**DeepMind SIMA** is a generalist AI agent for 3D virtual environments evaluated on **600 tasks** across **9 games** using only screengrabs and natural language instructions, achieving **34%** success compared to humans' **60%**. The model uses a multimodal Transformer architecture. **Andrej Karpathy** outlines AI autonomy progression in software engineering, while **Arav Srinivas** praises Cognition Labs' AI agent demo. **François Chollet** expresses skepticism about automating software engineering fully. **Yann LeCun** suggests moving away from generative models and reinforcement learning towards human-level AI. Meta's **Llama-3** training infrastructure with **24k H100 Cluster Pods** is shared by **Soumith Chintala** and **Yann LeCun**. **Deepgram's Aura** offers low-latency speech APIs, and **Modal Labs' Devin AI** demonstrates document navigation and interaction with ComfyUI. Memes and humor circulate in the AI community.
