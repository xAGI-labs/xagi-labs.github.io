**OpenAI** announced the **o3** and **o3-mini** models with groundbreaking benchmark results, including a jump from **2% to 25%** on the **FrontierMath** benchmark and **87.5%** on the **ARC-AGI** reasoning benchmark, representing about **11 years of progress** on the GPT3 to GPT4o scaling curve. The **o1-mini** model shows superior inference efficiency compared to o3-full, promising significant cost reductions on coding tasks. The announcement was accompanied by community discussions, safety testing applications, and detailed analyses. \*Sama\* highlighted the unusual cost-performance tradeoff, and **Eric Wallace** shared insights on the o-series deliberative alignment strategy.
