**OpenAI** launched the **o1 model** API featuring function calling, structured outputs, vision support, and developer messages, achieving **60% fewer reasoning tokens** than its preview. The model excels in math and code with a **0.76 LiveBench Coding score**, outperforming Sonnet 3.5. Beta SDKs for Go and Java and WebRTC support with **60% lower prices** were also released. **Google Gemini 2.0 Pro (Gemini Exp 1206)** deployment accelerated, showing improved coding, math, and reasoning performance. Meta AI FAIR introduced research on training transformers directly on raw bytes using dynamic entropy-based patching. Commercial humanoid robots were successfully deployed by an industry player. **Hugging Face** researchers demonstrated that their **3B Llama model** can outperform the **70B Llama model** on MATH-500 accuracy using search techniques, highlighting efficiency gains with smaller models. Concerns about reproducibility and domain-specific limitations were noted.
