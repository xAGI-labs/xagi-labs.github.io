**Ollama** enhanced its models by integrating **Cohere's R7B**, optimized for **RAG** and **tool use tasks**, and released **Ollama v0.5.5** with quality updates and a new engine. **Together AI** launched the **Llama 3.3 70B multimodal model** with improved reasoning and math capabilities, while **OpenBMB** introduced the **MiniCPM-o 2.6**, outperforming **GPT-4V** on visual tasks. Insights into **Process Reward Models (PRM)** were shared to boost **LLM reasoning**, alongside **Qwen2.5-Math-PRM** models excelling in mathematical reasoning. **LangChain** released a beta for **ChatGPT Tasks** enabling scheduling of reminders and summaries, and introduced open-source **ambient agents** for email assistance. **OpenAI** rolled out **Tasks** for scheduling actions in **ChatGPT** for Plus, Pro, and Teams users. AI software engineering is rapidly advancing, predicted to match human capabilities within 18 months. Research on **LLM scaling laws** highlights power law relationships and plateauing improvements, while **GANs** are experiencing a revival.
