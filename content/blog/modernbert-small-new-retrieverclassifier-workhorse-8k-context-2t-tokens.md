**Answer.ai/LightOn** released **ModernBERT**, an updated encoder-only model with **8k token context**, trained on **2 trillion tokens** including code, with **139M/395M parameters** and state-of-the-art performance on retrieval, NLU, and code tasks. It features **Alternating Attention** layers mixing global and local attention. **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking** debuted as #1 in Chatbot Arena, and the **O1 model** scored top in reasoning benchmarks. **Llama** downloads surpassed **650 million**, doubling in 3 months. **OpenAI** launched desktop app integrations with voice capabilities. **Figure** delivered its first humanoid robots commercially. Advances in robotics simulation and a new physics engine **Genesis** claiming **430,000x faster than real-time** were highlighted.
