**OpenAI** launched the **ChatGPT Agent**, a new advanced AI system capable of browsing the web, coding, analyzing data, and creating reports, marking a significant step towards human-like computer use. The agent, distinct from and superior to **o3**, is considered the first public exposure of what was internally called **o4**, now merged into **GPTNext**. It features end-to-end reinforcement learning, can operate for extended periods (tested up to 2 hours), and is classified as "High" risk for biological misuse, with safeguards activated. Early benchmarks show mixed results, excelling in some tests like **WebArena** and **BrowserComp** but underperforming on others like **PaperBench**. Key figures involved include **Sam Altman**, **Greg Brockman**, and **Kevin Weil**, with technical insights from **xikun\_zhang\_** and risk commentary from **KerenGu** and **boazbaraktcs**. The launch sparked speculation about **GPT-5**, which was confirmed not to be the case.
