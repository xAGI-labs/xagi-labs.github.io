**Google** launched **Gemini 3 Pro**, a state-of-the-art model with a **1M-token context window**, **multimodal reasoning**, and strong agentic capabilities, priced significantly higher than Gemini 2.5. It leads major benchmarks, surpassing **Grok 4.1** and competing closely with **Sonnet 4.5** and **GPT-5.1**, though GPT-5.1 excels in ultralong summarization. Independent evaluations from **Artificial Analysis**, **Vending Bench**, **ARC-AGI 2**, **Box**, and **PelicanBench** validate Gemini 3 as a frontier LLM. Google also introduced **Antigravity**, an agentic IDE powered by Gemini 3 Pro and other models, featuring task orchestration and human-in-the-loop validation. The launch marks Google's strong return to AI with more models expected soon. \*"Google is very, very back in the business."\*
