**Ilya Sutskever** has co-founded **Safe Superintelligence Inc** shortly after leaving **OpenAI**, while **Jan Leike** moved to **Anthropic**. **Meta** released new models including **Chameleon 7B** and **34B** with mixed-modal input and unified token space quantization. **DeepSeek-Coder-V2** shows code capabilities comparable to **GPT-4 Turbo**, supporting **338 programming languages** and **128K context length**. **Consistency Large Language Models (CLLMs)** enable parallel decoding generating multiple tokens per step. **Grokked Transformers** demonstrate reasoning through training dynamics affecting memory formation and generalization. **VoCo-LLaMA** compresses vision tokens with LLMs improving video temporal correlation understanding. The **BigCodeBench** benchmark evaluates LLMs on **1,140 coding tasks** across **139 Python libraries**, topped by DeepSeek-Coder-V2 and Claude 3 Opus. **PixelProse** is a large **16M image-caption dataset** with reduced toxicity.
