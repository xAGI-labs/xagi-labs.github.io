**Search+Verifier** highlights advances in neurosymbolic AI during the 2024 Math Olympics. **Google DeepMind**'s combination of **AlphaProof** and **AlphaGeometry 2** solved four out of six IMO problems, with AlphaProof being a finetuned **Gemini** model using an AlphaZero approach, and AlphaGeometry 2 trained on significantly more synthetic data with a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism. Despite impressive results, human judges noted the AI required much longer time than human competitors. Meanwhile, **Meta AI** released **Llama 3.1** with a 405B parameter model and smaller variants, and **Mistral AI** launched **Mistral Large 2** with 123B parameters and 128k context windows, outperforming Llama 3.1 on coding tasks and multilingual benchmarks. This marks significant progress in AI mathematical reasoning, model scaling, and multilingual capabilities.
