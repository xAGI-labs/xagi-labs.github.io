**Google Cloud Next** announcements featured the launch of **Google and DeepMind's** full **MCP support** and a new **Agent to Agent protocol** designed for agent interoperability with multiple partners. The protocol includes components like the **Agent Card**, **Task communication channels**, **Enterprise Auth and Observability**, and **Streaming and Push Notification support**. On the model front, **Moonshot AI** released **Kimi-VL-A3B**, a multimodal model with **128K context** and strong vision and math benchmark performance, outperforming **gpt-4o**. **Meta AI** introduced smaller versions of **llama-4** family models: **llama-4-scout** and **llama-4-maverick**, with a larger **Behemoth** model still in training. **DeepCoder 14B** from **UC Berkeley** is an open-source coding model rivaling **openai's o3-mini** and **o1** models, trained with reinforcement learning on 24K coding problems. **Nvidia** released **llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b** on Hugging Face, noted for beating **llama-4-behemoth** and **maverick** and competing with **deepseek-r1**.
