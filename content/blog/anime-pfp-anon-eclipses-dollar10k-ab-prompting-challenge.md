**Victor Taelin** issued a $10k challenge to GPT models, initially achieving only **10% success** with state-of-the-art models, but community efforts surpassed **90% success** within 48 hours, highlighting GPT capabilities and common skill gaps. In Reddit AI communities, **Command R Plus (104B)** is running quantized on **M2 Max hardware** via **Ollama** and **llama.cpp** forks, with **GGUF quantizations** released on Huggingface. Streaming text-to-video generation is now available through the **st2v** GitHub repo. **WD Tagger v3** was released for mass auto-captioning datasets with a WebUI. Lesser-known prompting techniques like self-tagging and generational frameworks produced thought-provoking outputs in OpenAI discussions, including experiments with self-evolving system prompts. Stable Diffusion users discussed image composition importance for training character LoRAs and best checkpoints for video game character generation. Discussions also covered scarcity of **5B parameter models** and open(ish) licenses for open source AI. Memes included jokes about ChatGPT and Gemini training data differences.
