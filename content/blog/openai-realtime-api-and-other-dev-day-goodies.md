**OpenAI** launched the **gpt-4o-realtime-preview** Realtime API featuring text and audio token processing with pricing details and future plans including vision and video support. The API supports voice activity detection modes, function calling, and ephemeral sessions with auto-truncation for context limits. Partnerships with **LiveKit**, **Agora**, and **Twilio** enhance audio components and AI virtual agent voice calls. Additionally, OpenAI introduced vision fine-tuning with only 100 examples improving mapping accuracy for **Grab** and RPA success for **Automat**. Model distillation and prompt caching features were also announced, including free eval inference for users opting to share data.
