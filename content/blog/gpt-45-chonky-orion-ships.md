**OpenAI released GPT-4.5** as a research preview, highlighting its **deep world knowledge**, **improved understanding of user intent**, and a **128,000 token context window**. It is noted for excelling in **writing, creative tasks, image understanding, and data extraction** but is not a reasoning model. **Microsoft unveiled Phi-4 Multimodal and Phi-4 Mini**, open-source models integrating **text, vision, and speech/audio**, with strong performance in **math and coding tasks**. **Cohere released Command R7B Arabic**, an open-weights model optimized for **Arabic language capabilities** targeting enterprises in the MENA region. The community is exploring the impact of larger models on creative writing, intent understanding, and world knowledge, with GPT-4.5 expected to be a basis for GPT-5.
